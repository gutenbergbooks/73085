<h3>1</h3>

<p>On my father’s side, according to my family belief,
I am related to Cotton Mather; on my mother’s
side to Roger Williams. My great-great-uncle was
Francis Asbury, the first Bishop of the Methodist Church
to be ordained in America; his elder half-brother was
my great-great-grandfather, Thomas Asbury, who, disowned
by his father for various sins, ran away from
the family cottage in England and went to sea. Later
he kidnapped Susan Jennings and married her, and
then settled in Virginia and so escaped the fate of the
Bishop, who doubtless went to the Methodist Heaven.</p>

<p>My great-grandfather was the Rev. Daniel Asbury of
Fairfax County, Va., an early pillar of Methodism and
one of the great organizers of the Church in the South.
When a young man he went to North Carolina, and in
1791 founded, in Lincoln County, the first Methodist
church west of the Catawba River. Later he was a Presiding
Elder and labored valiantly for the Wesleyan
God. When but a boy he was captured by the Indians
and kept a prisoner for several years, and is said to have
converted the entire tribe to Christianity. Throughout
his whole life Sunday was his great day—he was born on
Sunday, converted on Sunday, captured by the Indians
on Sunday, released on Sunday, reached home on Sunday,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
was ordained as a minister on Sunday, and on a
Sunday married Nancy Morris in Brunswick County, Va.
His first child was born on Sunday and he died on Sunday.</p>

<p>My grandfather was the Rev. William Asbury of
North Carolina, a local preacher who, for some reason
that I have never known, quit raising souls to Heaven
and moved over into Mississippi, where he had equally
poor success raising coons and cotton. He married
Susan Lester Marks, member of an equally religious
family. Several of his seven sons were Methodist
preachers, and my father, too, would have assumed
the cloth had not the Civil War come along. He enlisted
in the Confederate Army and became an officer of
infantry, and infantrymen do not make good preachers.
At the close of the War he studied Civil Engineering
and then moved to Missouri, and settled in Farmington,
where I was born. He was county Surveyor of my home
county of St. Francois for more than thirty years, and
City Clerk of Farmington for twenty years. The exigencies
of local politics compelled him to attend services
and take an active part in church work, but I have
no recollection of him as a religious man, although he
imposed religion upon his home and impressed upon
his family the necessity of Christian salvation.</p>

<p>I first suspected that he might not be as religious as
reported when I whacked him across the shins with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
broomstick as he sat in the yard one day nursing his
rheumatism. He did not turn the other shin. This was
not long after we had moved from the cottage across the
street from the Masonic and Catholic cemeteries to our
new house on the other side of the town, near the mansions
of our first families, the Webers and the Cayces.
Curiously enough, these graveyards were side by side,
although their occupants presumably went to different
Heavens. There was a high fence between them, and it
was not easy to dispose of the border-line burial plots;
the Protestants felt that a few Catholic demons might be
able to crawl through or under the fence, and the Catholics
did not wish to have their mortal remains so close to
those of such benighted heathen as the Methodists and
the Presbyterians.</p>

<p>My mother’s people, the Prichards and the Blues, came
originally from North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee,
and were for the most part devout Baptists, believing
that in immersion alone was true salvation. The strength
of their religious convictions may be seen in the fact
that many of them never forgave my mother for marrying
a Methodist and transferring her letter to my father’s
Church, forsaking the austerities of her family faith.
They considered the Methodists too liberal! The true
Baptist of those days was in a constant emotional upheaval;
his religion was a canker that ate deeper and
deeper, and he was able to find no relief; the more religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
he became, the more miserable he was. On the
other hand, the Methodist enjoyed terrific and periodical
emotional explosions, and thereafter was generally able
to live for a few days in comparative calm. But the
Baptist was wrapped in gloom from the moment of his
conversion until he was called home to Jesus.</p>

<p>When my mother’s forbears came up from the South
they settled within a radius of twenty miles of Farmington,
many of them in the vicinity of Hazel Run and
French Village. They were farmers, with a sprinkling
of small storekeepers, preachers and country doctors.
My mother’s father, Joseph Prichard, was a farmer, but
he was very religious and was renowned throughout the
countryside around French Village for his exploits as a
faith healer; he could cure toothache, remove warts and
stop the flow of blood. His method was merely to say:
“It will be gone by the time you get home,” and generally
it was. He frequently removed warts from my own
hands; at least they vanished within a reasonable time
after he had looked at them and pronounced his incantations,
and I regarded him with awe.</p>

<p>There was a tradition in our family that my grandfather
boasted Indian blood in his veins, and although
I do not think it was true, at the time it gave me great
pride and satisfaction; it invested me with authority at
such times as we played Indian and Wild West games.
He made a two-year trip overland to California during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
the 1849 gold rush, without conspicuous success, and
brought back with him the musket with which we were
given to understand he had slain innumerable Indians.
Two or three times a year his children and his grandchildren,
a vast horde all told, held family reunions
at his French Village farm, and the big moment of the
day came in the afternoon when all of the grandchildren
trooped into the woods behind the barn to watch
Grandpa kill a squirrel. We stood in a half-circle, almost
overcome by awe, while my grandfather loaded his
gun with great care, pouring the correct amount of
powder from his powder horn and dumping the bullets
from his pouch into the palm of his hand, where he
counted them carefully. And then he killed the squirrel,
while we stood behind him and marveled. He never
failed; he was an excellent rifle shot; in his ninety-first
year, three years before he died, he knocked a squirrel
from a tree as easily as Davy Crockett could have done it.</p>

<p>As a young man in Georgia and later in Missouri my
grandfather Prichard was famous as a leader of Baptist
sing-songs. His favorite hymn was “The Prodigal
Son,” which he was wont to bellow with fanatical fervor
as he sat bolt upright in an uncomfortable, straight-backed
chair and directed the singing with a stick. He
sang from an old hymn book which had been in his
family for many years, a curious volume with the music
printed in square notes. Many of the hymns expressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
sentiments that to-day, even in religious circles, would
be considered obscene. I recall one that said: “Oh,
sinners! My bowels do move with desire!”</p>

<p>I was constantly under the influence of my mother’s
people, who did what they could to overcome the pernicious
influence of the Methodists; they prevailed upon
me to visit them and attend their revivals and other religious
meetings, and otherwise attempted to oversee and
assure my eventual salvation. Some of my father’s people,
too, had come up from the South, from Virginia and
North Carolina and Mississippi, and had settled around
Farmington. Many of them were excessively pious, although
it is my recollection that they did not carry their
love of God and man into the conduct of their temporal
affairs; religion was not permitted to interfere with business.
Between them and my mother’s people there was
a constant, although not open, fight for my soul, and the
souls of my sister and brothers. The bout appears to
have been a draw.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>We were a musical family. My elder brother and
I played the harmonica, or French harp, as we called it
then, and my sister performed capably upon the organ,
the guitar and the mandolin. She was particularly
adept upon the guitar, and enjoyed an enviable reputation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
for the way she whanged out the fandango pieces
and the tune descriptive of the Battle of Sebastopol,
which requires much banging and thumping and difficult
fingering. My father was a fiddler. He did not know
one note from another, but he could tuck his fiddle
under his chin, tap the floor with his foot and play with
great spirit such tunes as “Fisher’s Hornpipe,” “Billy
in the Low Ground,” “Turkey in the Straw” and “The
Arkansas Traveler.” But his muse was dumb if he
could not pat his foot. I could also beat a snare
drum passably, and later I learned to play the violin,
the cornet and the alto horn, so that we had quite a
family orchestra, and our house was frequently
filled with music. Anyhow we played these instruments.</p>

<p>But not on Sunday. Our Preacher assured us that
music on Sunday, except in church, was sinful and an
affront to the Heavenly Father, and on Saturday night,
after a final orgy of melody, my mother gathered up
the guitars and mandolins, the fiddles, the drums and
the harmonicas and all of the other musical instruments,
even the jew’s-harp, and put them under lock and key
until Monday morning. We could not even play a
comb on Sunday, although on rare occasions, usually
when the Preacher was there and gave permission and
absolution from sinful consequences, I was permitted
to bring out my big harmonica, from which I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
produce the sonorous tones of an organ, and play church
hymns such as “Rock of Ages” and “Nearer, My God,
to Thee.” But I was forbidden to play “Turkey in the
Straw” or “The Mocking Bird” with variations. The
latter was my favorite tune, because by jiggling my
hand over the harmonica I could produce a very effective
trill which I fondly believed was as beautiful as the
singing of a canary, but if I launched into such a tune
on Sunday I had debauched the Sabbath, and my harmonica
was taken from me. And frequently I myself
was taken into the woodshed and taught a proper respect
for the Lord’s Day.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances could we play the fiddle in
our house on Sunday, because of all music, that which
came from the fiddle was the most sinful. It was the
Devil’s instrument. No fiddling on Sunday had been a
cardinal rule of my father’s family since Colonial days
in Virginia, and later in Mississippi and in North
Carolina my grandmother had compelled her Negro
slaves to put up their musical instruments from Saturday
night to Monday morning. Eventually I took lessons
from the music teacher in Farmington and learned
to call the fiddle a violin, and as I grew older I played
when I pleased, although not very successfully. But so
long as the instrument remained a fiddle it was played
in our house on Sunday on only one occasion. And
then the performance was a neighborhood scandal, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
only the fact that the instrument had been played by a
Preacher saved us from getting into trouble with God
and His representatives in Farmington.</p>

<p>This tweaking of the heavenly nose occurred during a
District Conference, when the visiting preachers were
parceled out among the faithful of the local Methodist
church. Two came to us, one a young man filled with
good works and a constant, fretful worry over the low
estate of the human race, and the other an old man who
had been a wicked sinner in his time and who had never
been able to resist an occasional temptation to have
a good time. He was a Virginian and an accomplished
fiddler, but he could play nothing but dance music,
which the darkies had taught him. The first Sunday
they were at our house my father admitted that we had
a fiddle, and the old Preacher demanded that it be
brought out for him to perform upon. My father and
mother were in terror all afternoon for fear that the
neighbors would hear the wailing of the fiddle, although
they prevailed upon the old man to use a mute
and the music could hardly be heard outside the room.
We were particularly afraid that a devout Sister, who
lived next door to us and whose principal occupation
was going to church, might hear it; if she had
it would have been nothing short of a catastrophe,
for the tale would have been all over town before nightfall.
So we closed the windows and the doors, muted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
the fiddle and put the old Preacher in the parlor, where
he fiddled until he had sinned enough. But even then
several people passing along the street heard it, and I
do not think that we ever quite lived it down. We
could convince no one that the fiddle had been played
by a Man of God. Everyone knew better; Men of God
did not do such things.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Every Wednesday night we attended prayer meeting,
and on Sundays we went to Sunday school and
twice to church. And on Sunday afternoon, and on
week days, there were the sessions of the various church
organizations. We had grace before meat in our home,
and when the Preacher came to dinner he delivered long-winded
prayers on the universal theme of “gimme.”
We did not have that emotional orgy called family
prayer, but I did not escape it; I encountered it in many
Farmington homes and in the houses of almost all of
my relatives.</p>

<p>It was particularly oppressive in the home of an
oppressively devout kinsman whom I called uncle. He
was not actually my uncle; he was related to my father
by marriage, and I do not believe there was any blood
kinship, but I thought of him as uncle, and he had a certain
measure of authority over me, so that to a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
extent I was under his control and subject to his
influence until I became intelligent enough to have an
occasional thought of my own.</p>

<p>My uncle was an extraordinarily pious man, an
official of our church and of our Sunday school, and a
leader in every movement designed to entice the sinner
from his wicked ways and lead him to the true religion
of the Wesleyans. He was intent upon salvation for
everyone, and let no opportunity pass to serve the Lord.
He frowned upon laughter, and although he had a very
charming family, there was little joy in his home; a
laugh seemed to make him uncomfortable and start a
train of dismal religious thought, and I gathered the
impression that all mirth was a direct and studied
affront to God.</p>

<p>Every night after dinner, or supper, as we called it
then, his living room was given over to family prayer.
I frequently spent the night with his youngest son, my
chum for many years, and was compelled to attend
with the others and absorb my nightly dose of religion,
and listen to a solemn account of the fearful things that
God would do to us if we strayed from the path of
righteousness. There was no laughter, and there were
no jokes; the whole atmosphere of the house turned
gray and gloomily oppressive when my uncle rose
from his seat, glanced sorrowfully at his family, and
announced:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“We will now have prayers.”</p>

<p>He turned and with bowed head passed into the living
room. We sat at the supper table for a moment
in silence, myself seeing goblins and fearsome avenging
creatures of God leering at me from every shaded
corner of the room, and my mind racing madly over
the day’s activities to discover what I had done that
required an alibi. In a few moments my aunt arose
and went slowly into the other room, and then one by
one the others. We marched solemnly, with downcast
eyes; we might have been going to a funeral. Indeed,
it seems to me now that we must in truth have been going
to a funeral; here was a fine house built for the
warmth of human happiness, turned into a forbidding
mausoleum by the mere mention of God.</p>

<p>In the living room Uncle awaited us, standing beside
the small table on which, always, there was nothing
but the Family Bible. He waited in silence until
we had taken our places, and then he laid reverent
hands upon the Book and began fumbling with the
pages, glancing sharply over his spectacles to make sure
that everyone was undergoing some sort of emotional
upheaval, and looking particularly for some sign of
revolt from his son and myself. I doubt if he ever
knew it, but when I attended family prayer in his house
I did not think of revolt. I was in an agony of fright;
I felt as if something was crushing me, and that something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
was my uncle’s God, an avenging monster ready
to devour me for my sins. God was in the house and
I was afraid.</p>

<p>The most uncomfortable chairs in the house were
used for family prayer, and we perched upon their
edges, afraid to sink back and relax, because we had
been told many times that discomfort and righteousness
were well-nigh synonymous. God would have been
scandalized and indignant had we made ourselves comfortable
to listen to His Word. And then my uncle
read from the Bible. He read without joy; he held
in his hand the Book which in his eyes was the sole
hope of humanity, the Book that contained the glad
news that for all mankind there was salvation, but he
read it as if it were a sentence of death, slowly and
solemnly, dwelling with horrible clarity upon those
phrases that promised punishment. The Bible seemed
to have no effect upon him but to make him gloomy and
miserable.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of his reading, he slowly closed
the Bible and placed it upon the table. He then stood
for a moment in profound thought, his chin resting
upon his breast. I assumed that he was overcome by
contemplation of the sins of a wicked world. Those of
us who were young began about this time to itch with
that devilish itch which invariably afflicts a youngster
when there is a penalty for scratching. We itched and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
itched, but we were afraid to scratch because God
was in the room, and we knew as well as we knew anything
that He would punish us if we moved. And finally
my uncle stared at the ceiling and said:</p>

<p>“Let us pray.”</p>

<p>With almost the precision of automata we knelt by
our chairs, our knees grinding into the hard carpet,
while my uncle’s voice soared in a sonorous appeal to
the Lord to give us some of this and some of that, to bless
us and make us prosperous, and, in effect, to hell with
such infidels as Jews, Catholics and Presbyterians. And
then he rose slowly to his feet and passed from the
room, without speaking. We followed, and scattered
about our various affairs, but it was a long time
before we could shake off the effects of the religious
debauch and play with any zest. And nearly always
I awoke some hours later in the throes of a nightmare,
pursued by fiends and demons shrieking that I
was to be boiled and fried and cooked in the fires of
Hell.</p>

<p>Every night year after year this sort of thing went
on in houses all over Farmington, and for that matter
all over the United States. It would be interesting to
know how many hours were wasted in the course of a
year by such senseless appeals to the Heavenly Father,
by this constant reiteration of “gimme, gimme, gimme.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span></p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Many of my relatives on my mother’s side attended
Colony Church, about three miles from Farmington.
This was a hard-shell Baptist congregation, the members
of which took their religion with the utmost seriousness
and were constantly on the lookout for sin to
rear its reptile head. If it did they assailed it with glad
cries. There was no organ in this church; indeed, for
many years none of the Baptist churches in and about
Farmington would permit any sort of music at their
services, holding that music was an invention of the
Devil designed to entice Christians from respectful contemplation
of the mercies and graces of the Lord, and
that no devout Christian could hear music and still
keep his mind on God and his heart true to the faith.
Their attitude toward the organ was exactly that of
the good Sister of whom Will Carleton sang in his
Farm ballads:</p>

<p>In later years, of course, the Baptists became almost
civilized and most of their churches bought organs;
in some there were even pianos. But in few of the
churches of the Farmington countryside, in my early
youth, was there more fervent religion on tap than at
Colony Church. There were frequent revivals, and
many basket dinners, when the farm women brought
huge quantities of food to the church early in the morning,
and all day long the congregation gave itself up to
an orgy of eating and saving souls. At most of these
revivals there were foot-washings; they were usually
announced at the morning service for the afternoon,
and then there was a great scurrying home or to the
nearest creek, or crick, as it was generally called, where
the feet were washed vigorously with soap and made
presentable for public exposure in the aisles and around
the pulpit of the church.</p>

<p>One of the most famous of the Colony Church foot-washings,
one that is still talked about when the good
Brothers and Sisters get together in that neighborhood,
ended the enmity of a widow, Sister Letts, and a lawyer
whose name I do not recall. For years there had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
great bitterness between them, and although the congregation
had prayed for them and had exhorted them
to forgive, the Lord had not entered their hearts, and
so they continued to treasure their hate. But at length,
on a Sunday morning during a revival, the preacher
announced that there would be a foot-washing that
afternoon, and the Brother rose and spoke:</p>

<p>“I have opened my heart to God,” he said, “and He
has instructed me to forgive Sister Letts. This afternoon
I shall wash her feet.”</p>

<p>There was a murmur of enthusiasm all over the
church, and one leather-lunged Brother popped to his
feet and shouted: “Amen, Brother! Glory to God!”
And then Sister Letts bounced to her feet and cried that
she, too, praised the Lord and would wash the feet of
the Brother.</p>

<p>That afternoon the church was crowded. Almost
every family of the countryside was on hand to see God
end this bitter quarrel which had come so near to disrupting
the congregation. The service proceeded as
usual, opening with some such catchy hymn as “Bringing
in the Sheaves,” and then through the sermon to the
slow, solemn songs like “How Firm a Foundation” and
“Nearer, My God, to Thee.” Then came the foot-washing,
when the Brothers and Sisters proved their
humility and showed that when it came right down
to brass tacks they were no better than Jesus Christ. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
was felt that the legal Brother and Sister Letts should
have the honor thus to show off first before God, and
so for a little while no one moved when the Preacher
announced that the time had come, and that basins
of water and towels would be provided.</p>

<p>But at length the Brother got to his feet and marched
stiffly down the aisle to the pulpit, where he procured a
pan and a towel. With these in hand he paraded back
up the aisle toward the last row, where Sister Letts
rocked back and forth and murmured in ecstasy:</p>

<p>“Praise the Lord, Brother! Praise the Lord!”</p>

<p>Moving slowly to a chorus of amens and unintelligible
mumblings of piety, the Brother was some distance up
the aisle when Sister Letts started to meet him. Halfway
between the back door and the pulpit they stopped,
facing each other. And then a new difficulty arose.
They had by now thoroughly given themselves to God
and were suffused with a wonderful glow of self-appreciation
at this proof of their humility, but each
wanted to prove it first. Each appeared to feel that
the one who first washed a foot would receive the greater
amount of kudos from the Lord.</p>

<p>So they began to argue, and the heat of the discussion
spread all over the congregation, and here and
there Brothers and Sisters became so upset by the spirit
that they jumped to their feet and began shouting
loudly, bouncing up and down and flinging their arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
about. My sister, a small child, was practically overcome
by curiosity, and added to the excitement by leaning
too far from her seat and falling into the aisle, so
eager was she to see the ceremony. She was promptly
spanked and put back in place by my Aunt Ophelia, and
several devout persons near her intimated strongly that
she was a sinful, blasphemous little wretch.</p>

<p>It seemed for a time that there would be a deadlock,
as neither Sister Letts nor the Brother was willing to
give in. So the congregation sang a hymn while they
stood staring at each other, and then the Preacher prayed
to the Lord to make a decision as to who should wash
whose feet first. And apparently God said Eeney
Meeney Miney Mo and picked Sister Letts to be It, for
the Brother suddenly surrendered and sat in a chair
which had been pushed into the aisle for him. He
bared his foot, and Sister Letts dropped to her knees and
poked it into the basin of water. I do not know if the
Brother wriggled his toes. Having laved him, Sister
Letts plied her towel vigorously to a groaning chorus of
“Amen!” that arose from all parts of the church, and
then she sat in the chair and removed her shoe and
stocking and the Brother performed the ceremony. The
congregation, everyone filled to the bursting point with
emotion, then stood and sang quaveringly “How Firm a
Foundation.” Sister Letts and the Brother returned to
their seats. It was generally agreed that by washing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
each other’s feet they had practically assured themselves
choice seats in Heaven.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>I was fallow ground for all these seeds of piety, for I
was a highly emotional and excitable boy. I wept when
I heard slow music, I shivered with fear over the ghost
stories and the frightful tales of Hell that were told to
me with such regularity, and it was usually I who saw the
spooks when we played or hunted for bumblebees among
the tombs of the Masonic cemetery. There is no telling
what I might have seen had I ever been able to summon
sufficient courage to enter the Catholic cemetery
at night. I did go as far as just inside the gate once,
and immediately there arose in front of me an apparition
that to my mind could be nothing less than the
Devil himself. And this was not surprising, for I well
knew that the Catholics were worshipers of a false God,
and it was quite likely that their graveyard was the abode
of evil spirits.</p>

<p>Because of my temperament, which impelled me to
believe everything I was told, and because from time
to time I had shown indications of being a bad boy if
restraint were not exercised, I received more religious
instruction than my sister or my brothers. Again, there
was the matter of ancestry. Our family connections,
especially my father’s people, were very proud of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
relationship to the Bishop and our direct descent from
the Rev. Daniel Asbury, and they settled on me to carry
on the family tradition. There was much talk of sending
me to a theological school, and I appeared to be destined
for the Church, so that I was always waiting for
the call to preach, though conscious of a vague hope that
it would be delayed.</p>

<p>But I had no idea that I should escape such a fate, for
I accepted as a basic fact of life that in every generation
at least one Asbury should be a Methodist preacher.
Wherever I went I encountered the assumption that I
was to succeed the Bishop and the Presiding Elder, and
become a Methodist Messiah howling in the wilderness
of sin and shoving souls into the heavenly hoppers with
both hands. Everyone seemed to take it for granted,
and when I talked to a stranger he invariably said:</p>

<p>“Well, well! So your name is Asbury?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Kin to the Bishop?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! I suppose you will be a preacher, too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I guess so.”</p>

<p>If the person to whom I talked was himself a Preacher,
or a Brother, he would smile gently, pat my head with a
moist palm and say: “God bless you, my boy,” and
pad on down the street. I can recall but one person who
did not make some such senseless remark. He was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
hardware drummer from St. Louis, a fat, waggish person
in flashy raiment, doubtless a sinner, who stopped me as
I marched proudly past Doss’s barber shop carrying a
string of fish, one of which was as large a bass as was
ever taken out of the St. Francis River. He tried to
buy the big fish, and when I refused to sell he asked me
my name and the inevitable conversation followed. But
when I said to him: “Yes, sir, I guess so,” he wrinkled
his nose and said: “Don’t be a damned fool, kid.”</p>

<p>I felt a sudden rush of affection for this outspoken
person, although I shuddered at the thought of what
would happen to him if a Preacher or a Brother heard
him using profanity and told God about it. I proffered
him one of my string, a fine crappie, which he accepted
gratefully and on which he feasted later at the St. Francis
Hotel. Later in the evening I met him as he swung
blithely through the doors of Perringer’s Saloon, and he
jovially invited me in to have a glass of beer. I thought
he must be crazy; I would no more have entered a saloon
then than I would have committed mayhem upon the
Preacher. In later life, of course, I did enter saloons,
but have never been able to bring myself to bite a
preacher, although at times I have been sorely tempted.
But it was a long time before I understood what the
drummer meant when he said, as we parted:</p>

<p>“Well, look out, kid, and don’t let them put that
Bishop stuff over on you.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE MACHINERY OF SALVATION</h2>
</div>

<p>Farmington was about eight or ten miles from the
lead-mining district of Southeast Missouri, where a
great number of low foreigners were employed, but
God did not permit any ore to be found near us and so
kept our town holy and undefiled by their presence. We
did not greatly concern ourselves with their evil ways,
because we knew that foreigners were little if any better
than the beasts of the field, and that God had put
them on earth for some inscrutable purpose of His own,
with which we were not to meddle. Even the Preachers
and the amateur devil-chasers in such towns as Flat
River and Bonne Terre devoted their activities principally
to spreading the Gospel among the home-bred and
let the Hunkies carry on whatever nefarious practices
pleased them best. We didn’t want them in our
Heaven, anyhow.</p>

<p>Our town nestled in the foothills of the Ozarks, some
eighty-six miles from St. Louis and two miles from the
De Lassus station on the Belmont branch of the Iron
Mountain Railroad. But the civilizing influences of the
city seldom touched any of us except a few wealthy families
who could afford the railroad fare for frequent
trips. We had then some 2,500 inhabitants, the vast
majority of whom were devout workers for the Protestant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
God, especially on Sunday. During the week many of
them put sand in the sugar and weighed their thumbs
with the sausage, and otherwise engaged in legitimate
and profitable business enterprise, but on Sunday they
praised the Lord.</p>

<p>There were but two or three Jewish families in town
then, and I do not recall that they ever attempted to practice
their religion; certainly not in public. Doubtless
our God would have destroyed them if they had thus
flaunted their sin in our faces, and mocked us with their
heathen rites. It is my recollection that they attended
the Presbyterian church, but if so it was for business or
social reasons. The Catholics had a church, but they
were not numerically strong, and did not amount to
a great deal in the town’s scheme of things, although
they occasionally captured a city office or did a bit of
proselyting among the backsliders of the Protestant
congregations. They labored earnestly one whole summer
trying to ensnare my sister after her allegiance to
the Methodist Father had wavered, but they were unsuccessful.
She could not swallow the Pope, or the
holy images and the like. Nor could she learn to cross
herself properly, although I became much interested
and helped her; we used to go behind the barn and practice
in all seriousness, but we invariably found ourselves
giggling at the rite. And few things can destroy
religion quicker than a hearty giggle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>The Protestants of Farmington made little if any effort
to induce the Catholics to abandon their debaucheries
and embrace the true religion; generally we considered
them benighted heathens and crazy people and
let it go at that, confident that in due time God would
blast them with His wrath, destroy their churches and
perhaps send their young women to Heaven to be virgin
angels in a Protestant paradise. I was very eager to see
this wholesale destruction, and waited patiently for
many years, hoping that God would furnish advance
information to His intimate, our Methodist pastor, so
we would be able to view the performance. I strongly
favored an earthquake and a bolt of lightning, as being
more spectacular. But I am sorry to say that nothing
ever happened, although one night lightning struck
the steeple of the Catholic church and there was some
talk about town that God was limbering up His muscles
and getting ready to show what He could really
do.</p>

<p>Some of our most advanced thinkers conceded that
perhaps the Catholics and the few nondescripts who professed
religion for the sake of business but who would
not attend church, had their own God, quite different
from ours and unquestionably a very inferior Deity.
But people who held this view were considered entirely
too charitable; it was all right to admit that God might,
in the fullness of time, and out of that loving mercy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
which keeps half the world constantly at the throats of
the other half, relent and permit a few Catholics to enter
Heaven as low menials, but to say that they might have
a Heaven of their own was going a bit too far. Both
socially and spiritually they were on the other side of
the railroad tracks. They were simply not in our set,
and when any of them attended our parties, as sometimes
happened despite every precaution, it was a matter of
very great concern. Things may be different now, but
when I was a boy cringing before the threatening lash of
the Methodist God, there was grave doubt that anyone
who lived south of the Post Office would ever amount
to anything spiritually.</p>

<p>All of the reigning sects of the Protestants had
churches in our town. There was also a Lutheran
Church somewhere down by Schramm’s Ice Plant, but its
congregation was made up of Germans and what not,
who ranked scarcely higher than the Catholics and the
Jews. For some time during my final year in high
school I was devotedly attached to a young Lutheran girl,
and this attachment was the cause of considerable concern
among some of my relatives. It was, then, my intention
to marry her, although I quickly abandoned it
after I had tentatively broached the matter to one of my
aunts.</p>

<p>“She is not a Christian girl,” my aunt protested.</p>

<p>“She is a Lutheran,” I said. “They are Protestants.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“But some of their services are in German! How
can they be Christians?”</p>

<p>She was perfectly sincere. She believed firmly that
God understood no language but English, and that, having
no knowledge of German, He could not look with
favor upon a Lutheran. But it developed that this particular
Lutheran could not look with favor upon a
Methodist, which was probably an insult to our Methodist
God. It was a great many years before I overcame
my surprise that God did not do something about it,
yet He seems to have done nothing but make her happy
and her husband prosperous.</p>

<p>Most of the churches in our town were on Columbia
Street, the principal thoroughfare, and they and their
subsidiary schools were so numerous that we proudly
called Farmington “The City of Schools and Churches,”
and enjoyed great renown throughout Southeast Missouri
for municipal piety and Christian education. On this
street worshiped the Presbyterians, the Southern Methodists—this
was the church of the Asburys and enjoyed
special favors from the Lord—the Northern Methodists,
and the Christians or Campbellites. The Baptists had
a church in another part of town, in Doss’s Addition.
Each of these churches had a great many interlocking
organizations, including Home Missionary Societies,
Foreign Missionary Societies, Ladies’ Aid Societies and
other holy groups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>The Ladies’ Aid Societies of the Middle West have
become famous, and they deserve their renown. When
I was a boy they were in truth most noble organizations.
They rotated their meetings at the homes of the members,
performing at each house about once every two
weeks, according to the number of women who belonged.
Their sessions were excessively sanctimonious; they
opened and closed with prayer, and frequently some
good Sister would at other times feel the spirit of the
Lord working within her, and she would pop up from
the quilting frame or the shirt on which she was sewing
for the heathen and yelp an appeal to God to give her
something or damn somebody. There were also Bible-readings
at these meetings; in fact every time a member
of our church called on another member, a verse from
the Bible was read and a prayer was offered. And curiously
enough these devout Christian Sisters displayed a
greater liking for the books of the Old Testament than
for those of the New.</p>

<p>In all of our congregations there were many special
societies for young people, to which the children of the
godly had to belong and whose meetings they had to attend.
Their number was great, and the majority of
their titles escape me, but I recall such outfits as the
Christian Endeavor, the Loyal Temperance Legion, the
Epworth League, the Baptist Young People’s Union, and
the Sunshine Brigade. The Legion was a union organization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
of juvenile foes of rum, and we used to meet on
Sunday afternoons in the Presbyterian or Southern
Methodist church and hear lectures on the evils of drink,
after which we would stand, raise our right hands and
shout in unison:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent7">We hate Rum!</div>
<div class="indent7">We hate Rum!</div>
<div class="indent7">We hate Rum!</div>
<div class="verse">Our bodies will never be ravaged by drink!</div>
</div></div>

<p>The Sunshine Brigade was another union organization,
in which all of the churches combined, and was
composed of boys from eight to twelve or thirteen years
of age. We met two or three times a week, in the evening
after supper, generally on the spacious lawn of
Merrifield Huff, the lawyer, and first we heard a Bible-reading
and a prayer. Then we drilled, in military
fashion, under the command of older boys who had been
away to military schools. Then there were more verses
from the Bible, another prayer, and we were sent home
with unctuous commands to be good boys and think
often of the mercy of the Lord. They called us “Little
Soldiers of the Lord,” and “Our Group of Manly
Little Fellows.” There was nothing we could do about
it.</p>

<p>The activities of the Epworth League and the Baptist
Young People’s Union are too well known to require<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
comment; they persist to this day, and there seems to be
no likelihood that the present generation will make an
intellectual advance sufficient to laugh them out of existence.
Fortunately Farmington was spared the Young
Men’s Christian Association, and I had no contacts with
that remarkable agency of salvation until I went to
France with the American Army. Of my many encounters
with the Y. M. C. A. abroad, two stand out in my
memory. One occurred when I wanted a toothbrush,
while in command of a platoon of infantry in the support
line on the Vesle river front, between Fismes and
Bazoches. I walked the eight miles or so back to division
headquarters with a five-franc note in my pocket,
all the money I had in the world.</p>

<p>The Y. M. C. A. canteen was open there, and after the
secretary in charge had greeted me sweetly as Brother
and inquired after the condition of my immortal soul,
he produced a toothbrush, for which he wanted two
francs, then about forty cents. I said I would buy it,
there being no Red Cross hut near where I could have
got one for nothing, and laid down my five-franc note.
But the Y. M. C. A. man could not change it, nor could
we find anybody else around headquarters who could
do so. The Y man said that he could not let me have
the toothbrush without payment and put it back in the
case, and I walked the eight miles back to my command
without it, rejecting his offer of a free pocket Bible with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
the observation that the line was one hell of a place for
a Bible.</p>

<p>The second encounter with the Y. M. C. A. occurred
a week or so later, at La Pres Farm, on the same front
and on the road between Mont St. Martin and Chery
Chartreuve. I had about two hundred sick and flat-footed
infantrymen there, waiting for gas masks and
other equipment so they could be moved to the front,
and they had nothing to smoke. Neither did they have
any money, because they had not been paid for months.
To the farm came a Y. M. C. A. man laden with boxes,
and when I asked him what they were, he said cigars.
He showed them to my platoon sergeant and myself;
they were fine, fat, handsome smokes.</p>

<p>I suggested that he lay out his stock, and that I would
have the sergeant march the troops past in columns of
twos, so that each man could have a cigar.</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” said the Y man, “they’re fifteen-cent
cigars, but the boys can have them for ten cents.”</p>

<p>I told him that to my knowledge there was not ten
cents in the whole outfit, and suggested that he give the
cigars to the soldiers and look to Heaven for payment.
But he would not; he said that he had brought the cigars
to the line to sell and that he had to have the money for
them. So I did the thing that seemed best under the
circumstances. I took his cigars away from him, the
sergeant headed him for Division Headquarters, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
kicked him as hard as I could in the pants. The last I
saw of him, he was stumbling down the hill toward the
crossroad vowing vengeance. But I paid little attention
to him; I was busy handing out free cigars, and a few
minutes later everybody at the farm was puffing happily.</p>

<p>We had also in Farmington three denominational
schools, Elmwood Seminary, a girl’s college with primary
and grammar departments for both sexes, operated
by the Presbyterians across the street from their church;
Carleton College in the lower end of the town, a Northern
Methodist institution, and Baptist College, near the Baptist
church. Carleton and Baptist were coeducational.
I was educated—God save the mark!—at Elmwood and
Carleton, and at both there was much emphasis on religious
teaching. Carleton, of course, since it was run
by the Northern Methodists, was frankly a mill for grinding
out workers for the Lord, and they poured out of the
hopper in large numbers for many years. Gawky country
boys came from the farms around Bull Run, Hazel
Run and French Village, and down-state toward Libertyville
and Fredericktown, and entered Carleton College,
to emerge a few years later rip-snorting evangelists hot
on the trail of the Devil. Those who did not become
professional Satan-chasers developed, in the course of
time, into pussyfooting Brothers with keen ears for
scandal, gimlet eyes for boring searchingly and suspiciously
into all amusement and pleasure, and wagging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
tongues for scattering seeds of holiness. And God made
their teeth very sharp, for backbiting.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the Presbyterians in Farmington
comprised the liberal element, in so far as we had a liberal
element. This was because our wealthy families,
or at least our social leaders, were apparently Episcopalians
at heart and perhaps belonged to the Presbyterian
congregation only because we had no Episcopal
church. They were able to go to St. Louis frequently,
and did, and consequently acquired a bit of metropolitan
polish, and rubbed off some of our small-town intolerance
and roughness. From time to time rumors were
afloat that some of these people had been seen entering
Episcopal churches in St. Louis, but I have never heard
that they were verified.</p>

<p>But for many years this element had a virtual monopoly
of such sinful practices as playing cards, dancing
and buggy-riding on the Sabbath. I have heard several
Brothers and Sisters, and more than one doleful
and sorrowing Preacher, speak regretfully of the unholy
spectacle of a young man of one of these families
driving a spanking pair through the heart of the town
on Sunday afternoon, with an abandoned young woman
beside him and neither apparently caring one single
damn about the fate of religion. It was prophesied that
they could come to no good end. But the germ they
planted multiplied enormously.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TABOOS OF THE LORD’S DAY</h2>
</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>Sunday should be a day of gladness, and of light
and beauty, for it is then that the forthright religionist
is closest to his God, and when he is, if ever,
in communion with the Holy Spirit and presumably
receives instruction with which to confound the wicked
during the ensuing week. But in small communities
which suffer from the blight of religion it never is, and
when I was a boy in Farmington Sunday was a day of
dreadful gloom; over everything hung an atmosphere
of morbid fear and dejection. In the morning the
whole town donned its Sunday suit, almost always black
and funereal and depressing, and therefore becoming
to religious practice, and trudged sorrowfully and solemnly
to Sunday School and to church, there to wail
doleful hymns and hear an unlearned man “measure
with words the immeasurable and sink the string of
thought into the fathomless;” and beseech the Lord upon
the universal prayer theme of “gimme.” Then the village
marched, in mournful cadence, back home for
Sunday dinner. But before the meal was eaten the
juvenile members of the religious household were commanded
to remove their sabbath raiment, and were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
again permitted to assume the habiliments of the godly
until after supper, when the family clutched its Bibles
and wandered forth despairingly to evening service.</p>

<p>These excursions, with attendance upon the various
meetings of the young people’s societies and other church
organizations, comprised almost the sum total of the
Sunday activity of our town’s inhabitants. In recent
years the young folks there appear to have gone wholeheartedly
to the Devil, and are gallivanting about the
country in automobiles, listening to radios, dancing,
attending baseball games on the Sabbath and otherwise
disporting themselves in a sinful manner, but in my
youth we had to observe a very definite list of Sunday
taboos, in addition to the special don’ts laid down by the
more devout families, according to their fear of God and
the fervor of their belief.</p>

<p>We could not play card games on Sunday. Regulation
playing cards of course, were taboo at all times
in the best and most religious families, for God, we
were told, had informed the Preacher that cards were an
invention of the Devil, designed to lure true believers
into sin; but on Sunday we could not even play such
games as Lotto, Old Maid and Authors. On week days
these were considered very amusing and instructive
pastimes, although in some quarters it was felt that they
caused too much laughter, but if anyone so much as
thought of them on Sunday he was headed for Hell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>The taboo against drinking was in effect every day
in the week for the godly and their children, not on
account of the possible harmful physical effects of
liquor, but because God objected. And even the Town
Sot hesitated to take a drink on Sunday, for he knew
that every Preacher and every Brother and Sister would
be howling to God to damn his immortal soul and make
a horrible example out of him. And how they did love
horrible examples!</p>

<p>No indoor games were permitted. This taboo was in
force against “Drop-the-Handkerchief,” “Puss-in-the-Corner,”
“Ring-Around the Rosy,” and “London Bridge
is Falling Down;” in fact, it included everything the
Preacher could think of except games founded on the
Bible. That is, we could play games in which questions
of Biblical history were asked and answered, but they
had to be conducted in a very solemn and decorous
manner. At the first laugh, or at the first question based
on the more ribald portions of the Scriptures, such as
Numbers and Deuteronomy, the game was stopped and
everyone went home in disgrace. One of my young
friends who once asked what happened to Laban’s household
idol was soundly thrashed, as was another who requested
a young lady to enumerate the ingredients of
Ezekiel’s bread. The curious may learn what the Holy
Prophet ate by consulting Ezekiel 4:15.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>We could have no outdoor games; in many families,
indeed, it was considered irreligious to go out of doors
at all except to church. Restless boys were sometimes
permitted to walk around the block, and once in a great
while to play, if they did so quietly and remained in
the back yard, where, presumably, the Lord could not
see them. Anyhow, the neighbors couldn’t.</p>

<p>Parties and teas were forbidden, and we could not
visit on Sunday, as a general rule, except among relatives.
And such visits were usually turned into holy
sing-songs, but since most of the hymns were either
pornographic or slightly Sadistic, there were thrills
galore in this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Walking along the main street of the town on Sunday
was a sin of the first magnitude. Occasionally a group
would obtain permission to stroll sedately down to Old
Maid’s Springs and take kodak pictures in a refined
and genteel manner, but a young man and a girl caught
ambling along Columbia street were the objects of much
unfavorable comment. It was generally agreed that
they were no better than they should be, and often a
Preacher, or a Brother or Sister, would stop them and
order them to cease desecrating the Lord’s Day by such
frivolous conduct.</p>

<p>“Go home,” they would be told, “and pray to God
to forgive you.”</p>

<p>We could not go buggy-riding on Sunday until we
were old enough to take our hope of the hereafter in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
our hands and tacitly admit our allegiance to Satan.
Girls who did so and thus flaunted their sin were ostracised
by many of our best families, and were regarded
as abandoned hussies, if not scarlet women. A man
had to hold a good many promissory notes for his
daughter to get away with a thing like that.</p>

<p>The Lord did not approve of Sunday-night suppers,
and so we could not have them. In the homes of the
godly there was only a cold snack for the evening meal.
It was considered sinful to light a fire in the cook-stove
after twelve o’clock noon. One woman who moved to
Farmington from St. Louis had the brazen audacity to
give formal Sunday-night dinners, but she scandalized
the town and nobody would attend but a few Episcopalians
disguised as Presbyterians. And even they
could not bring themselves to wear evening clothes.
But God soon punished her; she was so severely criticised
that she finally went back to the city.</p>

<p>Dancing on Sunday, of course, or for that matter
on any other day, was the Sin of Sins. I was told,
and until I was almost grown believed it, that whoever
danced on the Sabbath would immediately be engulfed
in a wave of Heavenly wrath, and his soul plunged
into the Fires of Hell to frizzle and fry throughout
eternity.</p>

<p>Sunday newspapers were not considered religious, although
my father went to the Devil to the extent of buying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
them each Sunday and permitting my brothers and
myself to read the comic sections. Usually we went
to Pelty’s Book Store for them after church, bringing
home the St. Louis <i>Globe-Democrat</i>, the <i>Republic</i> and
the <i>Post-Dispatch</i>, together with a horde of small boys
whose parents would not permit them to read anything
on Sunday but the Bible, and who therefore came to
our house and sprawled all over the place reading
the comics and the magazine sections. My father was
severely criticized for buying the Sunday newspapers,
but he persisted in his wickedness. My prayerful uncle
would not permit them in his house; indeed, all of his
books but the Bibles remained in a locked case from
Saturday night to Monday morning. But when my
brothers and myself passed his home with the Sunday
papers under our arms he always stopped us, and kept us
waiting on the sidewalk for half an hour or more while
he glanced at them and eagerly devoured the news. But
he would not let us come in while we had the papers;
he would meet us on the walk, and we were not old
enough to object.</p>

<p>My father finally became very tired of this practice,
and himself went after the papers. The first day he
did this, my uncle was on his front porch, waiting for
us to come by, and he stopped my father and reached
for one of the papers. But my father would not let
him have any of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“No, no,” he said. “You do not believe in Sunday
papers.”</p>

<p>And thereafter my uncle did not read our Sunday
papers, although he occasionally visited us in the
afternoon and looked at them, after expressing his sorrow
at finding them in our house. Once he found his
son sprawled in our yard guffawing over the antics of
the Yellow Kid when he should have been at a meeting
of the Loyal Temperance Legion, lifting his childish
voice against the Rum Demon. My uncle chased the
lad home with threats of punishment, and then himself
took up the funny section.</p>

<p>Baseball games were played by the ungodly on the
outskirts of the town on Sunday, but the game was
frowned upon by the Preachers and the Brothers and
Sisters, who denounced it as a lure of Satan and predicted
dire spiritual tortures for the players. Small
boys who attended the games were soundly whipped,
but occasionally we became so feverish with the desire
to witness a contest that we slipped away from home
and watched the game, pretending that we were going
to visit relatives and listen to hymns played on an organ.
But there were always spies of the Lord at the
game to tell on us. It was this opposition to Sunday
baseball that drove my younger brother out of the
Methodist Sunday school, only a little while after I
myself had abandoned the church. He was in the class<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
taught by Brother Benjamin Marbury, a lawyer and an
exceedingly loud and bitter antagonist of baseball. He
denounced the game before his class one day, and my
brother said that he could not see anything wrong with
it. Brother Marbury stared at him sternly.</p>

<p>“Would Jesus Christ attend a baseball game on Sunday
if He were here?” he demanded.</p>

<p>My brother said he did not know, but thought He
would, and Brother Marbury immediately knelt and
asked God to forgive the blasphemy. My brother was
infuriated and never went back to Sunday school. His
comment was: “What did he have to bring Jesus Christ
into it for?”</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>We arose at the usual hour on Sunday morning, perhaps
a little later, and immediately after breakfast began
to get ready for Sunday school. There was hair to
comb, shoes to polish in the kitchen, cravats to tie around
necks that had become enlarged and reddened by various
activities on the playing fields, and there were nickels
to secrete for the collection boxes. Worse, there were
Sunday-school lessons and Golden Texts to learn, and
the catechism to memorize. Dressed in our Sunday
suits, our hair slicked moistly to our heads and Sunday-school
pamphlets in our hands, my two brothers and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
I went solemnly down to Newman’s corner, turned into
the unnamed street that ran past Elmwood Seminary
and then into Columbia Street and so to the Southern
Methodist church.</p>

<p>Ordinarily a trip downtown was a great deal of fun;
we tripped each other, poked each other in the ribs or
had two or three fights <i>en route</i>, varying with the
warmth of our friendship for other boys we met upon
the way. But on Sunday we went solemnly and fearfully,
first Emmett, then myself and then Fred, according
to age and stature. We met other similar groups,
arrayed as we were in their Sunday suits and clutching
their lesson pamphlets, and our greetings were subdued
and formal. We converged upon the church, and all
over town the bells tolled and the faithful marched to
hear God’s intimates explain His written word, and tell
us calmly and definitely what He meant by the most
obscure passages in His Book.</p>

<p>We sat in church for an hour and a half listening to
various versions of the Hebraic fairy tales. In our
church the Sunday-school room was set apart from the
main auditorium, but occasionally the attendance was
so large that it overflowed into the church proper. To
most of us Sunday school was torture, and I have no
doubt that it is still torture to most children. It may
be that I did not learn a great deal about the Bible in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Sunday school, but I do know that it was in Sunday
school that I first began to doubt the Book. I was
naturally curious and inquisitive, and even then, young
as I was, I could not swallow the miracles of Jonah
and the whale, and the idea of the virgin birth of Jesus
I considered absurd, because in common with most
small-town boys I had a very definite knowledge of the
procedure employed in bringing babies into the world.
Up to the age of seven or eight I thought the doctor
brought them in his suitcase, or that they grew on bushes
in the back yard and were plucked when ripe, but after
I began to loaf around the livery stable and the Post
Office building I acquired more correct information.
Nor could I believe that Noah’s Ark would have
held two of every living thing then upon the earth.
But the Preachers and Brothers and Sisters insisted
that these things were literally true; they denounced
anyone who doubted and sought for symbolical meaning
as an unbeliever and a blasphemous son of Satan.</p>

<p>My sister, at the age of ten, was the object of special
prayers and solemn conferences because, for no other
reason than that she wanted to be contrary, she expressed
a doubt of the Virgin Birth. She was in Mrs.
Judge Carter’s Sunday-school class at the time, but she
did not like Mrs. Carter and disagreed with her when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
thought she could do so without subsequent punishment.
Mrs. Carter frequently told her pupils, all little girls
about eight or ten years old, of the marvelous manner in
which Christ came into the world, but she told it so
vaguely that none of them had any real understanding
of it. One Sunday morning, after Mrs. Carter had read
something about the Virgin Birth, my sister said flatly
that she did not believe it.</p>

<p>“Don’t believe what?” asked Mrs. Carter.</p>

<p>“Virgin birth,” said my sister. “I think it’s foolish.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, she made this observation at a time
when the whole Sunday school was quiet save for the
mumbling of the catechism in various classes, and her
thin little voice reached every corner of the room. And
instantly there was a horrified silence, broken after a
moment by someone who said: “It’s that blasphemous
little Asbury girl.” Mrs. Carter was stunned; the effect
upon her was the same as if God had walked in the door
and announced that Buddha, or Zoroaster, and not Jesus
Christ, was His son. She stared for a moment at this
brash child who had defied religion and, in effect, denounced
the Holy Book.</p>

<p>“Mary!” she said terribly. “Do you realize what
you have done?”</p>

<p>My sister’s conception of virgin birth, or of any sort
of birth, was decidedly hazy. She thought Virgin
Birth meant that Christ had been born in a stable, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
she knew perfectly well that no nice child would be born
in such a place. Anyhow, she had heard so much
about it that she had become quite bored by it, and she
felt it incumbent upon her to deny it. But from Mrs.
Carter’s attitude she knew that she had said a terrible
thing; at first she thought of recanting, but she looked
about and felt of herself, and when she did not see any
avenging angels entering and could find no sign that she
had been stricken, she stuck to her guns.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “I just don’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“Mary!” said Mrs. Carter. “Go home and pray!”</p>

<p>So my sister went home, but I do not think that she
prayed. Mrs. Carter and the Preacher called that afternoon
and told my father and mother what had been said
and done that day in God’s house, and there was a considerable
to-do about it, both Mrs. Carter and the
Preacher dropping to their knees and praying, and insisting,
that my sister pray also for forgiveness. But
my father and mother took the attitude that since my
sister did not know what she was talking about, she probably
had not sinned to any great extent. But it was a
good many years before she again had courage to express
a doubt as to the Virgin Birth. And if she goes
to Heaven she will probably find that Mrs. Carter and
the Preacher have instructed St. Peter to catechize her
about it, and not to admit her until she has atoned fully
for her heinous offense at the age of ten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span></p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Some of our families in which there was an unfortunate
excess of girls permitted them to have callers on
Sunday afternoon, but such affairs were conducted in a
prim and prissy manner. Holiness was the motif. The
boy, if he had been a good lad all week and had done
nothing to affront God or the Preacher, was dressed in
his Sunday suit, and the young lady wore the frock that
was kept in reserve for weddings, funerals and baptizings,
and those cannibalistic exercises called the Lord’s
Supper. And it was definitely understood that if a
boy called on a girl on a Sunday, he was courting her,
and intended to propose marriage. They could not
talk; they must converse, and their conversation must be
on subjects both inspiring and uplifting. These bons
mots that are now known as wise cracks were frowned
upon, and a repetition of them resulted in the young
gentleman being shown the door.</p>

<p>The piano and the phonograph, in those houses which
possessed such wonders, were under lock and key and
covered over with draperies to hide them, for it was
God’s day and God wanted no foolishness. The girl’s
father sat in various strategic places about the house,
moving from one to another as his suspicions of the
boy’s intentions arose and subsided, and her mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
moved solemnly to and fro in her best crinkly silk dress.
There was nothing of joy in the hearts of a boy and girl
who underwent the torture of the Sunday-afternoon call;
to paraphrase the immortal song of Casey, God had
struck them out.</p>

<p>The first, and almost the last, young lady upon whom
I called on a Sunday afternoon lived near the waterworks,
and her father and mother, rocking solemnly
upon the front porch and doubtless reflecting gloomily
upon the wickedness of the race, presented such a forbidding
spectacle that I walked four times around the
block before venturing in. But at length I did, and the
then idol of my heart greeted me at the front door.
Ordinarily she would have seen me coming, and she
would have poked her head out of the window and
yelled: “Hey! I’ll be out in a minute.” Then we
would have piled side by side into the lawn swing and
begun swapping trade-lasts, and the air would have been
thick with appreciative squeals and “he saids” and “she
saids.” But this was Sunday, a day given over to the
glory that is religion, and so she met me at the door with
a prim and pretty curtsy. Her father gave me a gentle
but suspicious greeting, because to the religious parent
every boy thinks of a girl only in terms of seduction,
and her mother stopped her rocking chair long enough
to inquire:</p>

<p>“Did you go to Sunday school to-day, Herbie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“What was the Golden Text?” she demanded, suspiciously.</p>

<p>I told her and she asked:</p>

<p>“Did you stay to church?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Brother Jenkins preached such a beautiful sermon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>And then she smiled a gentle smile, sighed a dolefully
religious sigh and told her daughter that she could
take me into the parlor, that holy of holies which was
darkened and unused during the week, but opened on
Sundays for callers and on other special occasions such
as funerals and weddings. The room was extraordinarily
gloomy, because the curtains were never raised
enough to let in a great deal of light, and it smelled
musty from being closed all week. And invariably the
gloom was added to by a crayon portrait of the head
of the house, a goggle-eyed enlargement of a very ordinary
photograph by Trappe, which stood on an easel in a
corner.</p>

<p>I had considered this call an occasion, and with the
aid of my elder sister who was visiting us from Memphis,
I had made an elaborate toilet and had been permitted to
wear my Sunday suit. But I did not have a good time;
I had known this girl a long time and admired her intensely,
but she seemed suddenly to have changed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
She sat stiffly on one side of the room near a window,
hands folded demurely in her lap, and I sat as stiffly on
the other. We inquired coldly concerning each other’s
health, and I had prepared in my mind a suitable and,
indeed, quite holy comment on certain aspects of our
school life and was about to deliver it when her mother
called gently from the porch:</p>

<p>“Don’t play the piano, dear: it’s Sunday.”</p>

<p>My observation went unuttered, and we sat for some
little time in an embarrassed silence broken only by the
crunch of her mother’s rocking chair and the crooning
melody of a hymn, each wishing to Heaven that the
other was elsewhere. I yearned to hear the piano, but
this instrument, with its delightful tinkle and its capacity
for producing ragtime, was generally regarded as a
hellish contraption; in fact, any sort of fast music was
considered more or less sinful. If there had been an
organ in the house, the young lady would have been
permitted to play it, and we could have sung from the
family hymn book, provided we did so in proper humility.
But there was only a piano, and it was taboo.
Presently the mother spoke again:</p>

<p>“Don’t play the phonograph, dear; it’s Sunday.”</p>

<p>This admonition was modified later by permission to
play an organ record of the hymn, “Face to Face,” and
we played it over five times before the mother got tired
of hearing it. She said, “You’d better stop now, dear;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
it’s Sunday.” Then she suggested that we turn to other
means of entertainment.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Herbie would like to look at the album,
dear. Would you, Herbie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” I said.</p>

<p>So we looked at the album, stiffly and in silence, the
sacred book held on our knees, but we were very careful
that our knees did not touch. We dared not giggle at
the sight of the bushy-whiskered members of the young
lady’s family, and made no comment on their raiment,
which we rightly considered outlandish. We turned the
pages and stared, and the girl explained.</p>

<p>“That’s Uncle Martin.”</p>

<p>“Taken when he went to Niagara Falls on his honeymoon,
dear,” said her mother. “Uncle Martin was a
great traveler.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” I said, feeling that comment was expected.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like to travel, Herbie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Well, be a good boy and read your Bible and maybe
some day God will make you a great traveler.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“But don’t travel on Sunday, Herbie.”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am.”</p>

<p>And crunch went the rocker and we turned another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
page, to find Aunt Ella smiling gently at us through a
mass of glorious flounces and trains and switches. We
learned from the mother that Aunt Ella had been converted,
at an extraordinarily early age, during a revival
near Hazel Run, and had lived a singularly devout and
godly life. Then we looked through the stereopticon
at various places of interest, murmuring our awe when
the mother swished gently into the room and pointed out,
in a view of Niagara Falls, the exact spot where Uncle
Martin had stood. It was, she explained, one of God’s
rocks.</p>

<p>To my knowledge this family had some very comical
stereopticon views, scenes depicting the life of an unfortunate
tramp who was kicked heartily and effectively
at every place he applied for nourishment, but we did
not see them on Sunday afternoon. They were
Saturday-night stuff. Saturday night was nigger night
in Farmington, and the whole town let down the bars
somewhat. That was the night when those who drank
got tight, and when those who bathed got wet, and when
those who had amorous intentions did their best to carry
them out. Had I called on Saturday night I should
have been permitted to enjoy the adventures of the unfortunate
tramp, but not on Sunday. They had been
put away, under lock and key in the writing desk, and
would not be brought out until Monday. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
not calculated to promulgate a proper respect for the
Lord’s Day; they were considered downright wicked
one day a week and funny the other six.</p>

<p>Even in my infatuated condition an hour or so of this
was quite enough. Ordinarily this girl and I had much
in common; at that time I ranked her high among the
beautiful flowers of God, and had I stopped at her house
on a week day we would have had gleeful and uproarious
converse, although even then we would have been
liable to religious instruction and catechism from every
snooping Brother and Sister who saw us. But the taboos
that this Christian family had raised on its holy day
stood between us and could not be broken down; we
were horribly uncomfortable in each other’s presence,
and we never got over it. She was never afterward the
same girl. And when I took myself and my Sunday
suit into the sunlight of the porch her mother stopped
rocking and crooning hymns long enough to demand.</p>

<p>“Are you going to church to-night, Herbie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” I replied. “I got to.”</p>

<p>And so I went out of the gate and away from there.</p>

<p>This sort of thing in the homes of Farmington drove
all of the boys to more or less open revolt as rapidly as
they reached an age at which they felt able to defy
parental and churchly authority. By the time I left the
town the Sunday-afternoon callers, except those who
made unavoidable duty calls, were to be found only in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
the homes of the ungodly, where there was music and
pleasure and gayety, where the parlor was wide open
seven days a week and the phonograph blared and the
piano tinkled whenever anyone wanted to hear them.
To these houses also went the girls from the devout
families for clandestine meetings with their sweethearts;
they could not entertain anyone in the dismal mausoleums
into which their fathers and mothers had transformed
their homes. Many a small-town romance has
been blighted by the Sunday-afternoon call.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AGENTS OF GOD</h2>
</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>In Farmington we had not only those Preachers who
had been ordained to the ministry and so licensed to
preach by both God and man, but the town was overrun
with volunteers, Brothers and Sisters who shouted the
word of God whenever they could find an audience, who
gave the testimony at the camp meetings, the protracted
meetings, and at those orgies conducted by the professional
evangelist who chased the Devil from any town
that would guarantee him a fat fee. These Preachers
and their allies controlled Farmington to a very large
extent, and when they were defeated, at elections or
otherwise, they raised their voices in howls of denunciation
and called upon God to punish the guilty. It was
many years before I learned that a candidate endorsed
by a Preacher was not necessarily called by God to assume
the office.</p>

<p>It was essential for any man who wanted to hold public
office to profess religion and be seen at church, and
usually the more noise he made in religious gatherings,
the greater his chances of success at the polls. If any
candidate dared to hold views contrary to those of the
godly, a vile whispering campaign was started against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
him, and his personal life was raked over and bared
with many gloating references to the Christian duty of
the people to punish this upstart. Occasionally the ungodly
or anti-religious element elected a mayor or what
not, but generally religion triumphed and thanks were offered
to God, and then throughout his term the office-holder
was harassed by pious hypocrites seeking favors
and special privilege. My father, as county surveyor
and city clerk, was constantly being checked up to determine
if he remained steadfast in the faith.</p>

<p>I do not think that my father was regarded as a first-class
Christian in Farmington; I am sure that in many
quarters it was felt that he was more or less disgracing
his ancestry because he did not bound to his feet at camp
meetings and similar gatherings and make a holy show
of himself with hypocritical testimony. He went to
church, and until I was old enough to do pretty much as
I pleased, he saw to it that I went also, and to Sunday
school and Epworth League and other places where the
Methodist God could take a peek at my soul. But he
was only passively religious; he showed no tremendous
enthusiasm for the Wesleyan Deity, and he never made
a particularly active effort to keep me in the path that,
according to some, leads to spiritual glory.</p>

<p>In a religious sense I was annoyed much less by my
father and my mother than I was by the busybodies who
seemed to be appointed by the Lord to take care of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
everybody’s business but their own. Most of the religious
instruction that I received came from volunteers,
either relatives of my parents, or Brothers and
Sisters whom I encountered during my pathetic efforts
to have a good time. And, of course, from the Preacher.
To many of these I put questions; I asked them to explain
certain things in the Bible and in the church service
that I did not understand, and which seemed to conflict
with the little definite knowledge that I had of life
and human beings. Invariably I was told that the Bible
needed no explaining; I was merely to believe it and
have faith.</p>

<p>I was afraid of the Preachers in Farmington, and of
the Brothers and Sisters, desperately afraid of them, because
they filled my mind with horrible pictures of Hell
and the roaring fires of old Nick; their object in talking
religion to small boys seemed to be to frighten them
into being good. And I think that most of the other
boys were afraid of them, too, except such brave souls
as my cousin, Barney Blue, who was a “bad boy” and
afraid of neither God nor Devil. One of my great
moments was when I heard Barney tell a prying old
Brother to go to hell. And curiously enough, and incomprehensibly
to many of the good old people of
Farmington, Barney is to-day exceedingly prosperous
and well thought of in his community.</p>

<p>But there were very few like Barney; most of us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
trembled in our boots, even the red-topped ones we were
so proud of, when a Preacher or a Brother or Sister
came snooping about, head bowed under its burden of
religious horror, and demanded information as to our
conduct and the condition of our souls. In the cities
the cry of the youngsters was “Cheese it, the cop,” but in
Farmington it was “Look out, there’s a Preacher!”
We could not start a game of marbles anywhere in town
but one of them, or else a Brother or Sister, did not
pounce upon us and demand to know if we were playing
“for keeps.” And since we invariably were, and did
not know enough to tell the Preacher what was politely
called a fib, the game stopped then and there while we
absorbed a little religion and learned that God abhorred
little boys who played for keeps.</p>

<p>We were told that God had His eye on us when we
did such things, and that our Guardian Angels put black
marks in their little books every time we shot a marble.</p>

<p>“You must give your heart to Jesus,” we were told.
“He will not let you dwell in the Heavenly Mansions if
you persist in this sinful practice.”</p>

<p>We used to play marbles in a vacant lot behind the
Christian church, and it was a very fine playground,
with a level stretch on which the marbles rolled beautifully.
But we had to give it up, because the lot was
near the home of a Sister, who spent most of her waking
hours in front of her window, staring out through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
the curtains in a constant search for sin and scandal.
We had no more than drawn the ring and legged
for first shot than she came out on her porch and
shouted:</p>

<p>“Are you boys playing for keeps?”</p>

<p>And we answered in unison, politely, as we had been
taught:</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>She stopped the game, swooping down upon us with
the glint of the Heaven-born fanatic in her eye. She
told us that we were wicked and sinful and blasphemous
and Heaven knows what else besides to play for keeps
in the very shadow of a House of God. She invariably
threatened us with punishment ranging from spanking
to everlasting torment in Hell, and if we dared to say
anything to her other than the conventional “Yes,
ma’am,” she said we were saucy and threatened to telephone
our mothers. Occasionally she did so, and a
marble game behind the Christian church was then followed
by the wails of little boys being led into the woodshed.
She performed her war dance many times, and
finally we went to play near the livery stable. The atmosphere
there was not so uplifting, but at least we were
in peace, for the hostlers had no interest at all in our
immortal souls, although they were very much interested
in who won the marbles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>The livery stables in Farmington were a sort of symbol
of the heretical element of the town. The big Mayberry
&amp; Byington barn, down the block from Braun’s
Hotel and Saloon, was a particularly delightful place
to loaf; it was infested by sinners, abandoned wretches
who swore horrible oaths, smoked cigarettes, and drank
whisky and gin out of big bottles. The politicians
loafed there at such times as they felt they would not be
seen by the more godly part of our citizenry.</p>

<p>Two of our most celebrated darkies, Uncle Louis
Burks and Uncle Mose Bridges, spent most of their
time at the Mayberry barn, and we considered them
quite fascinating, especially Uncle Louis. He regaled
us with tales of the days when, in the South before the
Civil War, he had no duties except be the father of as
many children as possible; that was his job. He estimated
the number of his progeny anywhere from fifty
to five hundred, according to the amount of liquor he
had consumed before counting, and we generally gave
him the benefit of the doubt and called it five hundred.
We ranked him with the great fathers of the Bible, and
I recall that it seemed to me somewhat strange that the
preachers did not offer Uncle Louis’s achievements as
proof of the truth of certain portions of the Book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>Uncle Mose’s principal claim to our attention was his
dog, a sad-eyed little mongrel that trotted at the end of
a string everywhere Uncle Mose went. We were permitted
to play with the dog occasionally, much to the
disgust of our parents, as we invariably went home
scratching. Both Uncle Louis and Uncle Mose were regarded
as sinners, partly on account of their color. It
was not believed that a black man could enter the Kingdom
of Heaven, although the deluded creatures had
churches and prayed to God. And then their domestic
arrangements were somewhat haphazard, and Uncle
Louis frequently boasted that he did not marry all the
mothers of his children before the War. Both he and
Uncle Mose were familiar figures around Farmington
for many years; they did odd jobs at the homes of the
godly, and for their pay received part cash and part religious
lectures and prayers. They thrived on the cash,
and apparently the prayers did not hurt them.</p>

<p>It was at the livery stable, also, that the drummers
from St. Louis, waiting for rigs to take them to the
towns of the lead-mining district around Bonne Terre,
Flat River and Elvins, left their stocks of stories. The
coming of a drummer was an event with us; it meant
that we should hear things that were not meant for our
little ears, and that for a little while at least we could
revel in the sight of a man given over to sin and seemingly
enjoying it. He used to assure us solemnly that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
playing marbles for keeps was not a sin anywhere in the
world but in Farmington, and tell stories, which we regarded
as fanciful untruths, of towns in which little boys
did not have to go to Sunday school.</p>

<p>The drummer came in on the herdic from De Lassus
before the interurban railroad was built, and he was
generally a gorgeous spectacle. He was not welcomed
in our best homes, and even his presence in church
was not considered a good omen for the forces of righteousness,
so he could usually be found loafing in front
of the livery stable or dozing in a chair tilted against
the wall of the St. Francis Hotel. He brought with
him not only the latest stories, but the most advanced
raiment; the first peg-top trousers ever seen in
Farmington adorned the legs of a shoe drummer traveling
out of St. Louis, and they created a furor and established
a style. Soon our most stylish dressers had
them.</p>

<p>Besides being the abode of wickedness and the lair of
Satan, and therefore an extraordinarily fascinating
place, the livery stable was also the principal loafing
place of a darky who had fits. He was one of our
town characters, and was regarded by myself and the
other boys as a person of remarkable accomplishments.
We felt that to be able to have fits set him above us; we
gloated enormously when he suddenly shrieked, fell to
the ground and began foaming at the mouth. Our attitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
toward him was respectful, and he appreciated it.
He was, it seemed to me, proud of his fits. I have
known him to rise, finally, brush himself off and ask,
simply:</p>

<p>“Was it a good one?”</p>

<p>Generally we thought it was. This darky became
such an attraction for us that for a long time, when a
group of us could find nothing interesting to do, and
when there was for the moment no one in sight to remind
us of our duty to God and the church, it was the
custom for one of us to say:</p>

<p>“Let’s go over to the livery stable and see Tod have a
fit.”</p>

<p>We thereupon trooped solemnly to the big barn and
gathered in a circle about the darky, who was generally
sitting against the side of the building whittling on a
stick. We watched him silently for a while, and then
someone mustered up courage enough to say:</p>

<p>“Going to have a fit to-day, Tod?”</p>

<p>With the instinct of the true artist, Tod ignored us
for a time, intent upon his whittling. Finally he gave
us brief attention.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” he said, and returned to his task.</p>

<p>And then suddenly he uttered a blood-curdling shriek
and tumbled headlong from his chair. We watched,
fascinated, uttering little murmurs of “ah!” as he
writhed and moaned, and when it was all over we settled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
back with a little sigh of satisfaction. We felt that we
had seen a first-rate performance, and when the darky
had a fit in front of the Post Office, or in the yard of the
courthouse, his audience was increased by as many boys
and men as were downtown, shopkeepers leaving their
wares to run across and watch.</p>

<p>There was nothing of callousness in our attitude toward
the darky. My own feeling in the matter was
that Tod was having fits for our benefit, and because he
enjoyed it, but at length I came to learn that he could
not help it, that the poor fellow was ill. Then I was
sorry for him, and one day I asked one of our most
prominent Brothers why Tod had fits. He immediately
seized upon the question to give me some religious instruction.</p>

<p>“He has sinned,” said the Brother, “and God is punishing
him.”</p>

<p>He elaborated his statement, explaining that Tod had
probably neglected to attend Sunday school, or had not
read his Bible, and that he had thus become a blasphemous
sinner and was being properly dealt with. He
pointed out that I, too, might grow up and have fits if
I was not a good boy. Now, I did not want to have fits,
and neither did I want to be a good boy. I wanted to
have some fun; I wanted to run about, and play marbles,
and go swimming, and put tick-tacks against people’s
window on Halloween night. I wanted to do all sorts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
of things that good boys did not do, yet I most certainly
did not want to have fits.</p>

<p>“But, Uncle Si,” I said, “how do you know that God
is making him have fits? And why does God do it?”</p>

<p>“Herbie!” He was shocked. “You are blasphemous!
You must not question the wisdom of the Almighty.
I have faith, and I believe in God and the
holiness of His acts. I know that this man must have
sinned, or God would not punish him so.”</p>

<p>I was not prepared to confound this faulty logic; it
was not then the business of small boys to question anything
their elders told them, but to accept without comment
the pearls of wisdom that fell from bewhiskered
lips. But it seemed to me small business for God to
be engaged upon. Yet it did not cause me great surprise,
for I had long known that the God who pressed so
heavily upon Farmington was a conception of unutterable
cruelty, an omnipotent Being whose greatest joy
lay in singling out the weak and lowly and inflicting
horrible tortures upon them, to the vast and gloating
satisfaction of the Brothers and their kind.</p>

<p>Some time afterward, because I was worried over
this torturing and punishment of the darky whose writhings
had now become less an amusing exhibit than a
terrible manifestation of the Almighty, I asked another
Brother how he knew that God had a hand in it. But
neither he nor Uncle Si ever told me. None of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
were ever able to tell me how they knew so well what
God wanted and what God did not want; they merely
left with me the impression that on occasion they walked
with God and that God spoke to them and asked their
advice on the conduct of the human race. But the
source of their information I could not determine.</p>

<p>I have never found anyone who could satisfy my
curiosity on this point; I never then, or later, found a
religious enthusiast who would admit that he was offering
merely his personal interpretation of the utterances
that other men had credited to the Almighty.
But there was nothing that entered the mind of God that
the Preachers and the Brothers and Sisters of Farmington
did not know and that they could not explain and
apply to local affairs. They knew precisely what was a
sin and what was not, and it was curious that the sins
were invariably things from which they received no
pleasure. Nor was anything which paid a profit a sin.
They knew very well that God considered it a sin to
play cards or dance, but that He thought it only good
business practice to raise the price of beans or swindle a
fellow citizen in the matter of town lots, or refuse
credit to the poor and suffering.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>As I grew older, and began to be skeptical of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
I was told, I became increasingly annoyed not only by
the mental mannerisms of these people, but by their
physical mannerisms as well. Not only did they walk
as if their soles were greased, sliding and slipping
about, but they talked as if their tongues were greased
also. Their language was oily; they poured out their
words unctuously, with much roundabout phrasing and
unnecessary language. If they wanted to tell about a
man going across the street from the Court House to
the Post Office they would take him up the hill past the
Masonic cemetery, with side trips to Jerusalem and
other Jewish centers. If I went downtown and met a
man like Sheriff Rariden, who will always have a place
in my affections because he permitted his son Linn and
myself to roam the jail yard and stare through the bars
at the nigger prisoners, he would say:</p>

<p>“How’re you, Herbie? How’re your folks?”</p>

<p>But if I met a Preacher the greeting was this:</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Herbert. And how are your dear
father and mother?”</p>

<p>And then he patted me on the head, pinched my arm,
and padded away, sliding greasily along the pavement,
his eagle eye alert for little boys playing marbles or
for other signs of sin. He might have been skinny and
pitifully in need of food, but nevertheless I thought of
him as greasy. He had about him an unwholesome
atmosphere; I could not be comfortable in his presence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
I felt that he had to be watched, and when I became old
enough to understand some of the looks that he bestowed
upon the young and feminine members of his
flock I realized that he should have been.</p>

<p>I had not lived very many years before I learned to
look upon Preachers, and their familiars, the Brothers
and Sisters, as useless incumbrances upon an otherwise
fair enough earth. But while I hated all of them, with
a few natural exceptions, the one I always hated most
was the current pastor of our Southern Methodist
church. He was my spiritual father, the guardian of
my soul and the director of my life in the hereafter,
and he tried to see to it that I went into the hereafter
with proper respect for him and a proper respect for his
God. I had to call him Brother and be very meek and
gentle in his presence, and stand without moving while
he patted me on the head, asked me fool questions, and
told me how much God loved little boys and girls. He
called me a “manly little fellow,” which annoyed me exceedingly,
and I have the word of my young nephew
that small boys are still annoyed by it.</p>

<p>But he made it quite clear, out of his profound knowledge
of the wishes of the Almighty, that God did not
want little boys and girls to have a good time. Quite
the contrary. God wanted them to do exactly what the
Preacher told them to do; He wanted them to accept the
Preacher as their guide and their philosopher and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
believe everything they were told, without fretting him
with unanswerable and therefore blasphemous questions.
He wanted the little boys and girls to spend most of
their time praying to Him to “gimme this and gimme
that,” and the rest of it being little gentlemen and little
ladies, solemn and subdued, speaking only when spoken
to and answering promptly when called. God told the
Preacher, who relayed the message on to me very impressively,
that it was a sin to play marbles on Sunday,
or to play for keeps at any time; that it was a sin to
roll hoops on the sidewalk in front of the church or
rattle a stick against the picket fence in front of the
parsonage. Everything that I wanted to do, everything
that seemed to hold any promise of fun or excitement,
was a sin.</p>

<p>But it was not a sin to saw wood for the Preacher, or
to carry huge armfuls of sticks and fill his kitchen bin,
and it was not a sin to mow his lawn or rake the trash
in his back yard. The children of the godly were permitted
to do these things because of the profound love
which the Preacher bore for them; his motto was “Suffer
little children to come unto me, and I will put them
to work.” And since by his own admission the Preacher
was a Man of God, we were permitted to perform these
labors for nothing. A boy was paid twenty-five to fifty
cents, enormous and gratifying sums in those days, if
he mowed the lawn or raked the trash for a family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
given over to sin, but if he did the job for a Preacher or
a devout Brother, he received nothing but a pat on the
back and a prayer, or he could listen to a verse from the
Bible and a lecture on his duty to serve the Lord and,
incidentally, the self-appointed ambassadors of the
Lord.</p>

<p>Once when I was about twelve years old our pastor
telephoned my mother and asked that I be sent to his
house to help him perform certain tasks which should
have been done by the darky men of all work about
town. But our family did not wish to offend the
Preacher, so I did the work. And it was hard work.
I toiled all morning cleaning out the Preacher’s woodshed
and stacking split stove wood in neat piles, and
then I carried in enough to fill two big wooden boxes in
the kitchen. During this time the Preacher sat in his
study, holding communion with God, and I presume,
reading the Scriptures. Occasionally he came out to
the woodshed to superintend my work, ordering me to
do this and do that and scolding me because I did not
work faster, but he did none of the work himself. And
when I was through he told me to come into his study
and receive payment. I hurried after him, very weary,
but with pleasant visions of a quarter floating before my
eyes. I believed that was the least I should receive,
and to me it was a great deal of money; properly expended
at McKinney’s or Otto Rottger’s, it would keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
me in jawbreakers for more than a week, and there might
be enough left to buy a bag of peewees or an agate.</p>

<p>But I did not receive the twenty-five cents. The
Preacher closed the door when we got into his study, and
then he commanded me to kneel. He put a hand on my
shoulder, and he said:</p>

<p>“My dear boy, I am going to pray for you. I am
going to ask the Lord Jesus to enter your heart and make
you a good boy.”</p>

<p>And then he knelt and prayed somewhat in this
fashion: “O Lord Jesus, bless this little boy who has
this day performed labor in Thy behalf,” etc.</p>

<p>It was all very confusing. I went home somewhat in
doubt as to whether the Preacher or God owned the
woodshed.</p>

<p>But labor of little boys was not all that the Preachers
got for nothing. They were inveterate beggars, and all
of them had fine, highly developed noses for chickens
and other dainties; it was seldom that a family could
have a chicken or turkey dinner without the Preacher
dropping in. It is true that their salaries were not
large, but they had free use of the parsonage, and they
were not in dire circumstances at all. Yet they always
had their hands out, grasping; they were ecclesiastical
tramps begging for a donation. In our town we used to
give showers for them; many families made periodical
donations to the Pastor, and sometimes there were surprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
parties, when the Preacher and his wife were led
into a room and shown piles of old clothing, food and
discarded furniture, all of which was sent next day to
the parsonage. The Preacher was always pathetically
grateful for these things; he would kneel in the midst
of them and offer a prayer for the souls of the good
people who had thus given him the clutterings of their
cellars and attics, which they had no further use for.
He seldom had enough self-respect to refuse them.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>The notion was prevalent in Farmington, among the
Brothers and Sisters, that the Preachers were their servants
and should peddle God to them 365 days a year.
It was felt also that their wives should be constantly at
the Lord’s work; that they should be at home at all times,
available for consultation and prayer meetings, and that
when they went abroad they should dress soberly and
walk with due humility. The wife of Brother Court,
one of our Methodist pastors, was severely criticized for
her departure from this formula of conduct. Apparently
the Courts had means other than the salary paid
them by the church, and they kept a maid, which in
itself was enough to arouse suspicion that Mrs. Court
was not a true servant of the Lord.</p>

<p>But the straw that broke the religious back of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
Courts and hastened the end of Brother Court’s ministry
was the fact that Mrs. Court took a nap each afternoon.
This was considered nothing less than scandalous, and
for a long time our Brothers and Sisters refused to believe
that the wife of a man of God should so far forget
herself as to lie abed when she might be praying or sitting
at her front window looking through the curtains
for a sin to happen. But the story persisted, and was
broadcast by a discharged servant who swore that with
her own eyes she had seen Mrs. Court sound asleep at
three o’clock in the afternoon. Finally two Sisters appointed
themselves a committee of investigation. They
rang the bell at the parsonage one afternoon, and told
the maid that they had called to join Mrs. Court in afternoon
prayer, and, although they did not say it, backbiting
gossip.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Court,” said the maid, “is asleep and cannot
be disturbed. Can you call later?”</p>

<p>They could not. They had barely strength enough
to get home, but after prayer they revived sufficiently to
sally forth and carry the awful news throughout the
town. There could no longer be any doubt. The wife
of the Pastor of the Southern Methodist church took a
nap in the afternoon. The Sisters had called, and had
been so informed by the maid, and while a few chronic
doubters remained, the vast majority realized that in a
matter involving such serious consequences to Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Court’s spiritual welfare, a matter that directly affected
and almost destroyed her chances of going to Heaven,
the Sisters could not tell a lie.</p>

<p>So Brother Court soon resigned and accepted a call
to a town where members of his family could sleep when
they felt like it, and could even snore without jeopardizing
their immortal souls. Nor did his successor last
very long. He was an Englishman, and spoke in a high
nasal voice, pronouncing his words very distinctly, syllable
by syllable. He was criticized for several reasons.
One was that his favorite phrase was “and
an-gels can do no more,” and it was felt that it was somewhat
blasphemous to mention angels so often before
mixed company. And then he spoke from notes,
whereas it was a custom of our Pastors to preach
solely out of divine inspiration at the moment of delivery.</p>

<p>There was much talk about the new Preacher’s notes,
and it was felt that, somehow, he was lacking in devotion
to God; many Brothers and Sisters argued that if he
were really a Man of God he would not have to use notes,
but would be inspired and filled with words as he rose
in the pulpit. His finish came the Sunday morning
that the wind blew through an opened window and scattered
his notes, so that he had to leave the pulpit and
chase the scraps up and down the aisle before he could
proceed with his discourse. This was regarded as direct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
evidence that God had deserted him, and he left
town soon afterward.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>The personalities of the preachers of my home town,
impressed as they were upon my growing, plastic mind,
probably will remain with me always, but I am thankful
that for the most part their names elude me. I remember
clearly, however, Brother Jenkins and Brother
Fontaine, of our Southern Methodist church; Brother
Nations, of the so-called Christian church; Brother
Hickok, of the Presbyterian church, and, clearest of all,
Brother Lincoln McConnell, the professional itinerant
evangelist who “converted” me with the aid of half a
dozen strong-armed and strong-lunged Brothers and
Sisters who dragged and pushed me down the aisle of
the church to the mourners’ bench, where I was surrounded
and overwhelmed by “workers for the Lord.”</p>

<p>Brother Jenkins I recall as a meek, thin little man
with a sad smile and a classical appetite for fried
chicken. At the time I was very much in awe of him,
and listened to his every utterance with the most profound
respect. I thought him saintly, and concluded
that he and God were the closest sort of friends, and that
the Deity would not dare launch upon a plan for a new
universe or start a new war without consulting Brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Jenkins. But in truth he was probably only under-nourished.
Brother Jenkins was a demon quoter of
platitudes and Biblical passages; nothing happened that
it did not remind him of a quotation from the Bible.</p>

<p>Brother Fontaine was a plump man who would have
been jovial and possibly likable—that is giving him the
benefit of a great doubt—if he had not been so burdened
by the troubles of God and if he had not been so frightfully
aware of the responsibilities of his position as a
recipient and promulgator of Heavenly wisdom and
commands. He officiated at the wedding of my sister,
principally because our family belonged to his church
and the presence of another preacher at the wedding
would have deprived Brother Fontaine of a goodly fee
and made an enemy of him for life. Christian charity
does not function well when it hits the pocketbook. I
think my sister would have preferred Brother Hickok,
but she yielded to public opinion and Brother Fontaine
got the job. He arrived at the house chewing tobacco,
a habit of his which he disliked intensely in other men,
but for which he found justification for himself in the
belief that he walked with the Lord and that it was
tacitly understood he was to have a little leeway.</p>

<p>He was excessively sanctimonious; and so was his
wife. We have never forgiven her for her attitude at
the wedding. I recall that she looked suspiciously from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
time to time at the groom, and watched the whole proceeding
with an air that said there must of a necessity
be something wrong somewhere; for one thing, there
was quite a deal of laughter in our house that day, and
that in itself was a sign that the Lord was not hovering
over the housetop. Immediately after the ceremony
Sister Fontaine paraded up front and began waving her
hands back and forth before my sister’s face, shouting
at the top of her lungs: “Praise the Lord, Sister!
Praise the Lord!” We gathered that she thought my
sister should immediately fall upon her knees and thank
God that she had at last acquired a husband, even
though Sister Fontaine did not seem to think much of
him. But we were greatly offended; we considered it
a reflection on our family and wholly uncalled for, because
my sister was, in fact, neither old nor homely, and
she had had and rejected a great many first-class matrimonial
opportunities.</p>

<p>I had an intense dislike for Brother Fontaine and his
ways, and time has not softened my impression of him.
He dearly loved to be the only man in a feminine
gathering, where he could make heavy inroads upon
the cake and ice cream and lay down the law to the
adoring Sisters. I have seldom known a Preacher who
was not afflicted with this mania, but in Brother Fontaine
it had developed into a highly acute disease. I remember
that he was always present at our house when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
members of the Ladies’ Aid Society came once each week
for their bit of sewing for the heathen and to enjoy their
pleasant afternoon of scandal. He had no business
there; he did not sew and he did not contribute much to
the symposium, but he listened avidly and ate heartily.</p>

<p>It was “Don’t you think so, Brother Fontaine?” and
“I fear I must take issue with you, Sister. The Lord
provideth answers for all problems affecting human conduct.”
Fool talk like that.</p>

<p>It was the practice of our Southern Methodist preachers
to stand at the door of the church after every performance
and shake hands with the customers, making
such remarks as “Praise the Lord, Sister! Get right
with Jesus, Brother!” I always dreaded this part of
the service, and several young girls told me that they
did also. All of the preachers who did this, and almost
all of them did, shook hands with a clammy pressure
that put me in mind of an oyster, and it always seemed
to me that when a lady customer passed through the
door the Man of God invariably found it necessary to
sigh.</p>

<p>But although I cannot rate Brother Fontaine very
highly among the servants of the Lord, my younger
brother consigned him to even lower depths. They went
fishing together once, at Brother Fontaine’s request, and
Fred appeared at the parsonage with lunch, fishing
tackle and car fare. Brother Fontaine knelt and asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
divine guidance for the expedition, and then they
boarded a trolley car and went to De Lassus, to fish the
St. Francis River around Blumeyer’s Ford. Fred paid
his fare.</p>

<p>“You must pay my fare, too, Fred,” said Brother
Fontaine. “I am the minister.”</p>

<p>So Fred paid. There was nothing else that he could
do; he was afraid that if he did not Brother Fontaine
would whistle to God to call down an avenging angel
armed with thunderbolts and lightning. Then it developed
that Brother Fontaine had brought neither lunch
nor fishing tackle; he had brought only himself, and
being a Man of God that was sufficient. Perhaps he
felt that since his influence with the Almighty was undoubtedly
great enough to make the trip successful,
Fred had no right to expect him to bear any of the expenses
or furnish any equipment. So he used Fred’s
tackle and ate Fred’s lunch, and when that was not
enough for him he sent Fred a mile and a half to a
farmhouse to buy a bottle of milk, for which Fred paid
and which the reverend one guzzled without offering to
share it.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole day Brother Fontaine alternately
prayed and fished, but there must have been
something wrong with his connecting line to Heaven,
for he caught no fish. He finally turned the tackle over
to Fred, with the remark that Fred had not brought the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
right sort of worms, and with the further explanation
that worms being God’s creatures as well as fish, God
probably did not want the fish to eat them. Fred fished
earnestly; he was ordinarily a good and successful
fisherman, and it was a matter of pride with him not to
go home without a string. But neither did Fred catch
any fish, and he became increasingly annoyed at Brother
Fontaine.</p>

<p>The preacher apparently labored under the delusion
that Fred required religious instruction. He told,
several times, the story of the loaves and the fishes, and
many other Biblical fairy tales as well. Once, when
Fred was anxiously watching his cork and felt certain
that a perch was nibbling at his hook, Brother Fontaine
stopped him to read the Sermon on the Mount from a
Bible which he drew from his pocket. Everything he
saw reminded him of something in the Scriptures. So
passed the day, and when Fred came home that night,
with no fish, he ate heavily of supper and then dared
parental wrath by saying:</p>

<p>“No more of these damned preachers for me.”</p>

<p>Brother Nations is probably Farmington’s most illustrious
gift to religion. It is true that he eventually resigned
from the ministry and became Probate Judge
and Principal of the High School, but he remained a
steadfast adherent of the Protestant God and a singularly
devout and godly man. I presume he still is, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
he is the same Gilbert O. Nations who in 1924 ran for
President as the candidate of what he called the American
party, asking for the votes of the electorate on a
pro-Ku Klux Klan and anti-everything else platform.
I am told that he is now the editor of a magazine devoted
to baiting the Catholics.</p>

<p>Once when Brother Nations was principal of the
Farmington High School he whaled me because Barney
Blue and I had thrown snowballs at Jake Schaeffer, the
town truckman. I felt that the licking was coming to
me and I bore no malice; only the week before I had
thrown lumps of coal at Pete Anderson’s house across
the street and had been warned that the hurling of anything
at all would result in punishment. But after the
thrashing was over, Brother Nations told me that throwing
snowballs at Jake Schaeffer was a sin against God:
that Christ had reference to it when he said: “Let him
who is without sin cast the first stone.” I could not
plead that I was without sin, because it had been impressed
on me by every Brother and Sister and Preacher
that I met that I was practically broken out with it. But
young and gullible as I was, Brother Nations’ statement
sounded silly.</p>

<p>I could understand that from Jake Schaeffer’s viewpoint
I had sinned, and grievously, because Jake was
stooping over when the snowball struck and I had put
a stone in the center of it to make the snow pack tighter;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
I was willing to admit that and repent. But what did
God care if two boys smacked snowballs against a soft
part of Jake’s person? It seemed to me that if God had
been really interested in the matter He would have advised
Jake Schaeffer not to stoop over when two boys
were abroad with snowballs. Thus He might have prevented
a sin. Further, if God was as intelligent as I
had been led to believe, He must have known that boys
cannot resist the temptation to throw snowballs, and
since He made both the boys and the snowballs He was
responsible for the sin committed against Himself. But
Brother Nations appeared to believe that God had permitted
me to sin in order that I might taste the joys of
castigatory rebuke. And I did.</p>

<p>Brother Hickok was the only Preacher of those days
to whom I gave the slightest measure of respect. I had
a genuine admiration for him, but it was not because
he was a Preacher or because he pretended to any inside
knowledge of the customs of Heaven or the thoughts and
wishes of God. On the contrary, I have heard him admit
that there were things in the Bible he did not understand,
and I have heard him admit that there were passages
in it that he did not particularly care for. But I
liked him simply because he chewed tobacco without any
effort at concealment, and played lawn tennis on the
courts near our home, and because I suspected, every
time I saw him wallop a tennis ball or bite a chunk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
from a slab of plug-cut, that he was Wild Bill Hickok
in disguise.</p>

<p>About the time Brother Hickok came to Farmington
I acquired a book devoted to the adventures of Wild
Bill, Kit Carson, Buffalo Bill and other heroes of the
Western plains, and of them all I liked Wild Bill best.
He seemed to me to be everything that a man ought to be.
He had more notches on his gun than any of the others,
and it appeared that he could not so much as sneeze
without a redskin biting the dust. I put the question of
identity to Brother Hickok rather bluntly, and told him
I would respect his confidence, but he denied it, although
I gathered the impression that he was a relative of Wild
Bill and, of course, mighty proud of him. But I was
not satisfied, and for a long time I shadowed him in the
manner set forth by Old and Young King Brady in that
sterling nickel novel, “Secret Service,” hoping to learn
his secret. However, I never did solve the question to
my own satisfaction.</p>

<p>But principally I admired Brother Hickok because he
was the only Preacher I knew who did not proclaim incessantly
that he was a Man of God and therefore entitled
to the largest piece of pie, and because he was the
only one who did not seem to be impressed by my relationship
with Bishop Asbury. He didn’t seem to give
a damn about the Bishop; his only ambition, so far as
I was concerned, was to beat me at tennis, which he did.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
But from the others, and from the Brothers and Sisters,
I got the impression that the right reverend deceased,
seated at God’s right hand between Jesus Christ and St.
Peter, perhaps crowding the latter a bit, had nothing to
do but receive messages from the Almighty touching on
my conduct, and relay them to me by whatever Preacher
I happened to meet. For many years I thought that
God and the Bishop had a consultation on my case every
night.</p>

<p>I do not think that I shall ever forget Brother Lincoln
McConnell, although I probably should not recognize
him if I saw him to-day. I hope not. But for some
eighteen long years I have cherished a compelling desire
to stand him in a corner, minus his band and singers and
his other aids to emotion, and then bind and gag him.
After that I want to talk to him for hours and hours,
embellishing my remarks with such florid words as I
have acquired in various military and journalistic enterprises,
and possibly inventing new ones for the occasion.
He was responsible for the most miserable period of my
life. But it was he, too, who definitely kept me from
being a Preacher, or even a Brother, and so, perhaps, I
should thank him. If he had let me alone I might at
this moment be calling some other preacher Brother; I
might be an intimate of God, and a walking Baedeker
of Heaven; I might even be gloating over the glories of
a Heaven paved with gold and populated by angels, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
female, all beautiful, all amiable. Certainly I should
not be given over to a life of sin; that is to say, I should
not be having a pretty good time with this business of
living.</p>

<p>Brother McConnell, as I write, is a pastor of a Baptist
church in Oklahoma City, Okla., with occasional forays
onto the Chautauqua platform, and is a potent force in
the life of that abode of righteousness. But if reports
are to be believed, there are even there those who consider
him a blight. He has been the central figure in
several rows that have undoubtedly redounded to the
greater glory of God; he tried to prevent the citizens of
his town from seeing one of the best American plays of
recent years because it dealt a bit too truthfully with
certain aspects of religious fanaticism, and he erected a
radio broadcasting station which blanketed the city and
forced the population to listen, willy-nilly, to his sermons
and his ponderous pronouncements against sin.</p>

<p>I once wrote a magazine article in which I discussed
a few of the activities of Brother McConnell, and he
put me in my place in an interview which, it seems to
me, shows that he has not changed a great deal since the
time that I first shook hands with him as he leaned over
the mourner’s bench and beseeched me to give my heart
to his God. I give it here. It appeared in the Oklahoma
City <i>News</i>, on January 27, 1925.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“He is a very small potato.” That was the reply of the
Rev. Lincoln McConnell, First Baptist Church pastor....
“I have some doubt,” said the Rev. McConnell, “as to whether
I should feel honored or otherwise by the repeated mention
of my name in this article by Herbert Asbury without realizing
that this writer cannot possibly have inherited anything
more from his illustrious ancestry than his name.</p>

<p>“I confess that it is rather surprising to me that editors of
a magazine could attach enough importance to such cheap
drivel as this as to give it the position and the space they do.</p>

<p>“The natural assumption is that they believe about religion,
the religion of Christ, what this poor fellow does, and therefore,
actually believe that this ‘weak stuff’ is a contribution to
their cause.</p>

<p>“I remember Farmington, Mo., very well, having been there
about twenty-five years ago. I do not remember Herbert Asbury
at all.</p>

<p>“I am not surprised that I do not, as he must have been
then somewhat as he evidently is now—a very small potato—and
while I would feel naturally as interested in his conversion
as in anyone else, at the same time I am forced to admit
that it would not be possible for a man of training and
experience to list a man of his evident mentality very highly,
even though he were a professed convert in his meeting.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry that he was not really converted. If the
Editor of the <i>American Mercury</i> cares for things of a really
constructive nature, I can give him the life story of thousands
of men and women whom because of the genuineness
of their conversion to Christ in my own meetings, have given
to the world characters of such beauty and worth as have reflected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
credit upon themselves and their church and have
proved a blessing to society at large.</p>

<p>“I have never asked people to stand up if they want to
go to Heaven. I think that very ridiculous.”</p>
</div>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>It was these people who taught me of God, and who
had dominion over my spiritual welfare! And not only
did they instruct me to worship their conception of Him;
they threatened me with eternal damnation if I didn’t,
and with even more horrible punishment if I ventured
to cast doubt upon the truth and holiness of the Bible.
Eternal damnation meant that I should, in the life to
come, hang throughout eternity on a revolving spit over
a great fire in the deepest pit of Hell, while little red
devils jabbed white-hot pokers into my quivering flesh
and Satan stood by and curled his lip in glee. I received
the impression that Satan was the only one
actively concerned with religion who was ever permitted
to laugh. God was not, nor His disciples, and that
Satan could and apparently did was sufficient proof that
laughter was wicked.</p>

<p>And they described God to me, and told me in minute
detail of the architectural design of Heaven and the
furnishings of the Mansions in the Sky. I do not know
where they obtained their information. I gathered that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
God was an old man who wore a long white nightgown
and boasted a luxuriant growth of whiskers, with a disposition
compounded of the snarls of a wounded wildcat
and the pleasant conceits of a <i>must</i> elephant. He
chewed tobacco—perhaps that impression was due to
the fact that so many of our preachers were addicted to
the vile weed—and He had an enormous head which
contained an eye for every person on earth, and this eye
was constantly upon its object. And it was a vindictive
and jaundiced eye, peering into the innermost
depths of the soul and the mind and the heart for some
thought or feeling that might call for punishment.</p>

<p>The descriptions of Heaven and the physical appearance
of the angels varied somewhat, according to
whether the tale was told by a preacher or a Brother, or
a Sister. But all of them talked with gusto of streets
paved with gold and of clouds lined with silver, of magnificent
buildings constructed of precious stones, and of
angels sitting on the clouds with no worthier purpose in
life than strumming a golden harp, protected from the
weather by no more substantial raiment than a white
nightgown, a halo and a pair of sandals. And whoever
told the tale, there was always that underlying idea
of sybaritic magnificence; Heaven bore no resemblance
to the lowly stable in which the founder of their religion
was born, and it was not a somber retreat for the further
development of the soul and the cultivation of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
virtues that are lost sight of upon the earth. As it was
described to me in my youth, and as it is still described
on those rare occasions when I can bring myself to hold
converse with a Preacher, Heaven was a celestial reproduction
of the palace of a Babylonian monarch.
Nobody worked, and God’s House abounded with gold
and silver and rubies and diamonds, and on every cloud
that rolled down the street was a beautiful woman,
eternally young and amiable. The Heaven that I was
taught to aspire to was a motion picture set on an
even grander scale than the creations of Cecil De
Mille.</p>

<p>But even more emphasis was placed, in these tales,
on feminine virginity. It seemed that Heaven was filled
with virgins; I have never heard a Preacher describe an
angel without mentioning the fact that the angel was a
virgin, and I have never heard a Preacher describe
Mary simply as the mother of Jesus. She is always
the Virgin Mother, and he pronounces it all in capitals.
Even as a boy I was impressed with the frequency with
which the word “virgin” appeared in the discourses of
our Pastor and in the lectures so freely bestowed upon
me by the Brothers. It seemed to me that the word
fascinated them; although I might be trembling with
fear that God would strike me dead because I had not
learned my Sunday-school lesson or had forgotten the
Golden Text, I was so impressed that I found time to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
wonder at the enthusiasm with which they mouthed it.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible for Preachers or devout
Brothers to say “virgin” as casually as they did other
words; they gloated over it, toyed with it, rolled it about
their tongues and tasted the full flavor of it before it
slid drippingly from their lips with an amazing clarity
of pronunciation. Usually they accompanied it with a
doleful sigh. I thought then that the sigh was from excess
of piety, and I thought that their eyes shone and
their breath came a little faster from the same cause,
that these things were possibly manifestations of God,
and I was greatly impressed. But I am older now and
I know better.</p>

<p>When I became old enough to understand what was
meant by virginity, and to understand that it was something
more than a badge of the angels, I understood
also many other things that had hitherto been mysteries.
I knew then what was in the mind of one of the Brothers,
an extraordinarily devout man with an astounding
knowledge of the wishes of God and the manners and
customs of Heaven, when he stopped me on the street
one day and asked me what, if anything, had happened
on a recent hay ride to Blumeyer’s Ford and back by
members of our social set.</p>

<p>“Did the boys and girls sit close together?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. We had to. We were on a hay wagon.”</p>

<p>“Did you boys sit right up against them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>I told him we did, and in my youthful innocence I
remarked that I had been compelled to sit so close to one
girl that we could hardly tell our legs apart. The old
man drew a sharp breath, sighed and his eyes glistened.
He repeated the word “legs” with gusto, he gloated over
it, and then he said:</p>

<p>“You sat so close to her that your legs touched?
Your leg touched hers? Your leg was right up against
her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I had to.”</p>

<p>“The leg of a young virgin!” mused the old devil.
“That was wicked. It is wicked to think of the legs of
a virgin. God will punish you.”</p>

<p>He went away muttering to himself. I was disgusted,
not at his ideas, because I had practically the same
thought about virgins that he did, and so did most of the
other boys of the town, but at his manner. Here was an
old man who had set himself up as a mundane representative
of the Lord, who told me whom to worship and
how to worship Him, who held daily communion with
God and received messages from Him touching on my
conduct, gloating and trembling because a boy had sat
with his leg against the leg of a girl in the forced confinement
of a hay ride. God knows what is happening
to him if he is alive in these days of short skirts and silk
stockings.</p>

<p>Another of our Brothers, a very prominent member of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
one of our Protestant churches, kept a store in the business
district not far from the Court House. He was
waiting on a customer the day that the first woman to
ride astride in our town cantered down Columbia Street,
and his performance was a town scandal for many
years. He caught a glimpse of the girl through the
window, and he abandoned his customer and rushed to
the street, in company with half the county officials who
had been dozing with their feet on their desks, and all
of the town loafers. The Brother followed her for several
blocks, missing no detail of her costume, which
was rather bizarre and daring for those days, and then
he went back to his store and his customer.</p>

<p>He stood for a while wrapped in contemplation.</p>

<p>“She was riding like a man!” he said. “Her legs—her
legs——”</p>

<p>My experiences in these matters, of course, were principally
with Preachers and Brothers, but I had occasional
contacts with the Sisters. They, too, described
God and Heaven, but they did not conceive God as being
quite so old and feeble as the Being worshipped by the
Brothers, and for the most part they populated Heaven
with handsome, stalwart young men, presumably virgins.
I recall one exceedingly devout Sister who expressed the
belief that there were no female angels in Heaven, and
I have heard her praying with extraordinary fervor to
God, in effect, to make an exception in her case.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Whether she was justified in this optimistic opinion of
herself I never knew, but I assume that she and the
other Sisters, in their discussion of the virginity of angels,
experienced the same sort of vicarious pleasure
that seemed to mean so much to the Preachers and the
Brothers.</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>I did not go to many camp meetings; ours was not a
camp-meeting country. We went in more for protracted
meetings, and for the stirring revivals of professional
evangelists, held in comfortable church buildings. Usually
I went to camp meeting only because some girl
in whom I was interested had to go. But they were very
popular with a certain type of young man about Farmington,
who knew that religious emotion is very akin to
secular emotion; the line of demarcation is very thin,
and most men who have been around religious women
very much know that one emotion can quickly be transformed
into the other. Young girls are much easier
prey after they have been overwhelmed by religion, their
nerves upset and their brains whirling with emotion, and
they are then easily persuaded that the Lord will forgive,
even though His earthly agents will not. Of
course such a statement could not be proven, but it is
quite likely that more seductions have occurred at camp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
meetings, and <i>en route</i> to and from them, than on all the
front porches and lawn swings that were ever manufactured,
although in Farmington for many years a lawn
swing was regarded as a lure of Hell. Even while the
service was in progress the buggies around the meeting
tent were filled with men and women petting, or, as we
called it then, spooning.</p>

<p>Strange things happened at these camp meetings, and
at the other gatherings as well, when a forthright religionist
saw the light. At one such holy conclave an old
woman, for many years a thorn in the flesh of the godly,
suddenly bounced to her feet and shouted:</p>

<p>“Praise the Lord! My corn hurts! Praise the
Lord!”</p>

<p>And this, because it embodied physical suffering and
a great deal of mental torture as well, was accepted as
an infallible sign that God had at last entered her soul.
She had been converted, and all the rest of her life she
was a prying, sanctimonious old pest. She used to stop
me on the street and inquire as to the condition of my
soul, and ask me whether I said my prayers at night,
and whether I read the Bible, and she would grab me
by the arm and pinch me and demand the Golden Text
of the last Sunday-school lesson. And if by any chance
I had forgotten or did not know, she scolded me and predicted
dire things for me in the life to come. Incidentally,
she knew all about the life to come; it seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
that God had appeared to her in a vision, and had described
Heaven to her.</p>

<p>At all of these meetings extraordinary efforts were
made to ensnare the children and convert them to Christianity;
the workers for the Lord were not at all concerned
with the fact that the children did not know what
it was all about, that they had no opportunity to choose
their own religion, and with the further and obvious
fact that they succumbed to nothing but fright and a
great surge of emotion. That method persists. The
Church still obtains its converts by noise and appeals to
primitive emotion, and by threats, rather than by intelligently
implanting a true and deep-seated conception
of God and the heavenly wonders. But to the religionists
a convert is a convert, no matter how obtained; I
have known boys to be thrashed because they would not
profess religion.</p>

<p>As with the Catholic Church, the unspoken and always
denied slogan of the Methodists and of the other
Protestant sects is “Catch ’em while they’re young,” but
unlike the Catholics the Protestants cannot hold them.
For one thing, they do not put on a good enough show;
they do not understand lighting, and they have no uniforms
and no Latin chanters. A Catholic priest covered
by a surplice or what not, and his voice rising and
falling sonorously in the chanting of a bit of Latin, is
a very impressive spectacle, and his appearance lends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
dignity to his words. The gentle stare that most of them
wear is also effective. As soon as an embryo Methodist
becomes intelligent enough to visualize the sort of
Heaven that the Brothers are preparing for him, he shudders
and forthwith goes to the Devil, while the Catholics
fill their converts with such fear of God and the Pope,
or the Pope and God, to put them in the order of their
importance, that very few get away. A renegade Catholic
is almost as rare as a Methodist Preacher who does
not think he is sprouting wings, and that his voice is
truly the Voice of God.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A BAD BOY COMES TO JESUS</h2>
</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>It is clear, then, that not only was my ancestral background
religious, but that I lived in an atmosphere
heavy with religious feeling. Religion and the Church
dominated the whole of my early life. Among all of my
relatives I do not recall one whose home was not oppressed,
and whose life was not made miserable and
fretful, by the terrible fear of a relentless God whose
principal occupation seemed to be snooping about searching
for someone to punish. Religion was poured down
my throat in doses that strangled me and made me sick
of soul. There was simply too much of it. God was
fed to me morning, noon and night, and He did not
taste good; I was hounded from pillar to post by a pack
of baying, sanctimonious hypocrites beseeching me to
get right with Jesus, and to read and believe that collection
of Hebrew fairy tales called the Bible.</p>

<p>I came finally to think of God as I did of castor oil,
and the flavor that He left in my mouth was just as frightful.
He and His religion were personified by the dour-faced
men and women who went sliding about the town;
rubbing their hands together, scraping the skin from their
souls but not from their palms. They were irritatingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
gentle, and they sighed soulfully and mouthed platitudes
with enormous gusto; they called each other
Brother and Sister and poked their messy, prying fingers
into every bit of fun that anybody tried to have;
they fed their little shriveled souls with scandal and
smeared dirt over everything that was amusing. They
regarded all young men as professional seducers, and
for the greater glory of God ruined the reputations of
young girls who went buggy-riding and seemed to enjoy
it—and nothing can be so completely and irrevocably
ruined as the reputation of a young girl in a
small town.</p>

<p>But despite the feelings of disgust and revolt which
the labors of these servants of the Lord evoked in me,
I did not definitely align myself on the side of the non-believers
and the sinners until after I had been “converted.”
I began on that night to hate the Church and
its religion, and all of its prying, messy hypocrisy and
sanctimony. And especially I hated the preachers and
the Brothers and Sisters. I still do; they give me a
pain in the neck. I felt that I had been betrayed; I
knew that the spirit of God was not working in me, but
I was told that it was and dared to deny it. I was told
that I must “get right with the Lord,” whatever that may
be. I felt that the Brothers and Sisters and the evangelist
had taken an unfair advantage of my emotions; there
was a band at the revival, and under the influence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
music I will do anything. It compelled me to do
something that I did not want to do; it humiliated me
in my own eyes, and nothing that has ever happened to
me since has made me so miserable and ashamed.</p>

<p>I had reached the ripe old age of fourteen or fifteen
when the hand of the Lord, operating through the agency
of Brother McConnell and a horde of wailing Brothers
and Sisters with religious fervor breaking out upon them
like boils, reached out and plucked me from the burning.
But it was not their fault that I had not been converted
earlier; they had tried often enough. One of my earliest
recollections is of a Preacher asking me why I did
not profess religion and join the Church, and why I
had not given my heart to God, as he called it. I was
occasionally singled out at protracted meetings and at
revivals and made the object of special prayers, but until
Brother McConnell came with his improved technique
and circus methods I had always held out.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>My own church, of course, was the Southern Methodist,
but the revival meeting at which I was converted was
a union gathering in the Northern Methodist edifice,
which was about a block from Braun’s saloon and an
even shorter distance from the county jail. We called
it the Rock church because it was constructed largely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
of granite blocks. Its members were considered good
enough people in their way, but they were hardly among
the socially elect, for many of them lived south of the
Post Office among the Catholics and the Lutherans, and
in some circles it was suspected that they held, at times,
intercourse with the Devil. Nevertheless, they were
Methodists and Christians and first-class politicians, and
by this time they have probably assumed control of the
town.</p>

<p>All of the Protestant congregations of Farmington
chipped in to pay the $600 demanded by Brother McConnell
for his week’s work for the Lord. This was a
goodly fee, but it was not considered exorbitant, as
Brother McConnell was a professional devil-chaser with
a national reputation, and it was felt that he, if anyone,
could put Farmington on the right side of the heavenly
ledger. There was considerable rivalry among our
good people as to who should entertain the evangelist
and pay for his fried chicken and other delicacies, and
I do not recall who finally drew the plum. But the
family whose bed and board he graced was considered
very fortunate; it had practically assured itself of ultimate
salvation, since the emissaries of the Devil would
not dare to invade such a sanctuary of God.</p>

<p>Brother McConnell was an extraordinarily agile man.
Throughout his service, and particularly after the collection
had been taken up and found to be good, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
bounded back and forth about the pulpit, chasing the
Devil hither and yon, shaking his hair from his eyes,
sweating at every pore and roaring charges about dens
of evil that I, for one, was never able to find in Farmington,
although I headed several exploring parties. He
dealt largely in that sort of goods; to him, and to most
of the other preachers that I recall, morality and goodness
were nothing but chastity, and they never let an
opportunity pass to insinuate that the finest men in our
town whiled away their idle hours with scarlet women.
Their insinuations, of course, had no basis in fact; to
my knowledge there was but one professional scarlet
woman in town, and there simply was not time. However,
there were, to be sure, amateurs.</p>

<p>The church was crowded on the night I was told that
Jesus had taken possession of my soul. I sat about
the middle of the center section with my elder brother,
a phlegmatic boy who was also converted but who would
never talk much about it, while across the aisle were
my sister and my younger brother. Every few moments
the evangelist would stop shouting and sink back into
his chair, gasping, wiping his brow and breaking into
sobs as he bowed his head in a prayer that came in a
throaty mumble from his lips. Here and there throughout
the house was an echoing gasp and a strangled sob,
utterances of tortured and frightened souls about to be
swirled into a great wave of religious frenzy. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
standing in the aisle and about the pulpit were Brothers
and Sisters, experienced revival workers, eager retrievers
for the Lord, their faces flushed with emotion and
their eagle eyes roving the congregation in quest of just
such persons.</p>

<p>The instant the evangelist sat down, his band leader
popped up like a trained seal, and from the band and
the augmented choir poured the lilting measures of a
hymn.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Oh, that will be</div>
<div class="verse">Glory for me!</div>
<div class="verse">Glory for me,</div>
<div class="verse">Yes, glory for me!</div>
<div class="indent">When by His grace</div>
<div class="indent">I shall look on His face,</div>
<div class="verse">That will be glory,</div>
<div class="verse">Yes, glory for me!</div>
</div></div>

<p>The first hymn was usually something of this sort, a
tune with a swing to it, to get the congregation swaying
in rhythm, and to attract the uncertain sinners lounging
about the door and looking in, unable to decide whether
or not to enter. Usually they came in after hearing
“Glory” and a song or two like “Bringing in the
Sheaves” and “Jesus, Lover of My Soul.” Later the
choir swung into the doleful songs like “Rock of Ages”
and “Nearer, My God, to Thee.” The emotional appeal
was terrific; after the first hymn or two the audience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
joined, bellowing the words with fanatical fervor.
Murmurs began to arise as the evangelist alternately
talked and prayed, and then suddenly the music stopped,
the preacher shut off his talk and for an instant there was
a silence. It was theatrical hokum, but effective as always.
Then Brother McConnell leaped and lunged to
the front of the pulpit, his eyes glaring and his hair
streaming down before his eyes. He flung his arms
wide.</p>

<p>“Come to Jesus!” he shouted. “Brothers! Sisters!
Come to Jesus!”</p>

<p>He stood there trembling, imploring the sinners to
abandon their hellish lives, and the choir boomed into
song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Lives there a friend like the lowly Jesus?</div>
<div class="verse">No, not one!</div>
<div class="verse">No, not one!</div>
</div></div>

<p>All over the church now there were cries of ecstatic
agony as the victims writhed in emotional torture, and
after a little while people began jumping to their feet
and shouting:</p>

<p>“Glory! Glory to God! Hallelujah!”</p>

<p>The noise was deafening. People were shouting in
every part of the audience, they were weeping and
moaning. One old woman jumped to her feet, climbed
onto her seat and began to yell:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“I see Jesus! I see Jesus! I see Jesus!”</p>

<p>She repeated it over and over again, “I see Jesus!”
and finally she collapsed into her seat, mumbling and
weeping. The evangelist took up the cry. He roared
back and forth across the pulpit, shaking his hands
above his head, calling on God to damn the sinners.
His whole body quivered and he screamed at the top of
his voice:</p>

<p>“Jesus is in this house! Come to Jesus! Give your
heart to God!”</p>

<p>And above the roar of his voice and the rumble of the
seething congregation rose the music. It ebbed and
flowed, it beat against the rafters and rebounded from
the floor, always that regular beat of a hymn, like tom-toms
in the jungles of Hayti. Many of the choir members
sang hysterically, their voices rising on the high
notes into veritable shrieks, but there was no change in
the steady thunder of the organ or the wail of the violin,
and there was no escaping the emotional effect of the
song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Bringing in the sheaves,</div>
<div class="verse">Bringing in the sheaves,</div>
<div class="verse">We shall come rejoicing,</div>
<div class="verse">Bringing in the sheaves.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then there was testimony. Old skinflints who had
devoted their lives to cheating their neighbors, old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
women whose gossiping and backbiting were the talk of
the town, hopped into the aisles and told how, at some
previous meeting, God had entered their hearts and
made them pure and holy. Their voices rose to shrieks;
they grew red in the face from the fervor of their shouts,
and one old man who had only that day cheated half a
dozen men in a real-estate deal stood in the aisle with
his hands raised toward Heaven and wept bitterly over
the sins of the world. Tears streamed down their faces,
and many who had only a few hours before dumped
sand in the sugar groaned loudly in sympathetic torment,
and shouted “Amen, Brother! Amen!”</p>

<p>By this time Brother McConnell’s collar hung limp
about his neck, but his passion for the Lord was unchecked.
He stopped the testimony when it appeared
that everybody in the church wanted to say something;
there was another hymn and he began calling for converts.
He shouted that we were all wicked sinners and
must come to Jesus.</p>

<p>“All who want to go to Heaven stand up!”</p>

<p>Naturally, everybody stood up. He told them to sit
down; they obeyed, for he held them in the hollow of
his hand.</p>

<p>“All Christians stand up!”</p>

<p>Everybody stood up except my sister, and as I think
things over after the lapse of years I know that was what
first caused me to suspect that she was, and is, a remarkably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
intelligent woman. She said afterward that
she resented Brother McConnell’s holier-than-thou attitude,
and thought he was an old windbag. She could
not swallow his repeated assertion that he was a representative
of God, and that the Lord had sent him to
gather Farmington into the fold. She had, better than
anyone else there, control over her emotions; she could
not be stampeded. But for several years thereafter she
was the target of a great deal of missionary zeal; even
the Catholics tried their hands with her after it had become
obvious that she would not subscribe to the beliefs
of the Methodists, but all of it was unsuccessful.
They could not feaze her even when they pointed her
out as “that Asbury girl who wouldn’t say she was a
Christian.”</p>

<p>Half the men and women in the church were sobbing
while the band played, the choir sang its dismal tunes
and Brother McConnell swayed back and forth in the
pulpit and pleaded with them to get right with God and
confess their sins.</p>

<p>“Oh, Brothers, come to Jesus!” he cried. “Let God
enter your heart this night! Give your heart to Jesus!”</p>

<p>At the beginning of the moaning and groaning the
Brothers and Sisters who were to act as procurers for
the Lord scattered over the church, and as the services
went on they picked out the ones who seemed to be most
upset emotionally and therefore ripest for glory. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
hung over these poor creatures, sniveling down their
necks, exulting in their misery, exhorting them to march
down the aisle and see God. These Brothers and
Sisters, of course, had been converted many years before
and were O.K. with the Lord.</p>

<p>“Oh, Brother!” they pleaded. “Come to glory!
Give your heart to Jesus! Jesus died that you might be
saved! He died on the cross for you! Brother, come
to Jesus!”</p>

<p>And so on <i>ad nauseam</i>, with their continual repetition
of Jesus and glory, glory and Jesus. There was no attempt
at sensible argument, no effort to show the prospective
converts that the Christian religion was better
than the Mohammedan religion or the religion of Zoroaster;
there was nothing but a continual hammering at
emotional weaknesses. And finally the bewildered
brains of the victims sagged under the strain and they
stumbled into the aisles and were hauled and shoved
and pushed down to the mourners’ bench, and presumably
into the presence of God as embodied in His
earthly representative, Brother Lincoln McConnell.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>I was fair game for them. There was hardly anybody
in the church who did not know how emotional
and how excitable I was, and how music affected me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Why, I used to be thrilled over the way I myself played
the violin, and have been known to hang entranced over
a tune of my own composition! Even before the services
began I saw that many of the Brothers and Sisters
had spotted me and were only waiting the proper moment
to pounce upon me, and when the call for converts
came as many of them as could get near me pleaded and
begged and cajoled; they scrambled and almost fought
in their eagerness to ensnare such a prime morsel for
the Lord. They could have worked no more furiously
if God had been keeping the score. They screeched at
me that now was the time to see Jesus, that God was
waiting impatiently for me to be converted.</p>

<p>Some of them even threatened. They painted horrible
pictures of Hell; they told me that unless I went
down the aisle and confessed my sins and asked God to
forgive me I would sizzle and burn and scorch forevermore.
One old woman, her face working with fanatical
fury, screamed at me that I was holding up the salvation
of my whole family; that my father and my mother and
my sisters and brothers would not go to Heaven unless
I professed religion; she shouted that Satan was waiting
outside the church to lead me into the depths of Hell
and light a fire under my immortal soul. The whole
crew pushed and tugged and hauled at me; one Brother
got hold of my arm and tried to drag me into the aisle,
yelling “Come to Jesus! Jesus is calling for you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>And up on the platform Brother McConnell was rampaging
to and fro, working himself into a frenzy, shouting
that “Jesus wants you!” and above the roar of the
Christian workers and the moans of the victims rose the
wailing whine of a violin played off key, the thunder of
the organ and the emotion-filled voices of the choir.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Rock of Ages, cleft for me,</div>
<div class="verse">Let me hide myself in thee!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>By this time I was crying; I did not want to go to
Hell, and I was horribly afraid of the Devil, and I was
not old enough to realize what was being done to me.
Yet something kept telling me that I should not do this
thing; that it was all a mockery and a fraud. I know
now, and I knew soon after that night, that the music
was what was the matter with me, not religion. I did
not see Jesus, and I never have. It was that slow music;
that doleful, wailing chant of the hymns. I couldn’t
withstand it. I never could. In the army I used to go
to all of the funerals because I got such a terrific kick
out of the funeral march and the sliding tramp of troops
marching at half-step.</p>

<p>But I was doomed. It was in the cards that my self-respect
was to be stripped from me and that I was to be
emotionally butchered to make a religious holiday.
They dragged and hauled at me until I was in the aisle,
and then they got behind me and urged me forward.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
One old woman leaped ahead of us and performed a
war dance that would have done credit to a frenzied
worshiper of Voodoo. And as she pranced and cavorted
she screamed:</p>

<p>“A bad boy is coming to Jesus!”</p>

<p>Others were going down too, shepherded by the hard-working
Brothers and Sisters, and as they reached the
bench Brother McConnell reached forward and grabbed
their hands. For each one he shouted “Praise the
Lord! Another sinner come to Jesus!” and then he
gave the sinner an expert shove that catapulted him into
the hands of a waiting Brother who immediately knelt
with him and prayed. The team work was magnificent.
I tried to hang back, but the band began playing again.
The thunderous cadences of “Nearer, My God, to Thee,”
pealed from the organ, and I couldn’t stand it. I was
being torn to pieces emotionally, and I staggered and
stumbled down the aisle, sobbing, hardly able to stand.
They thought it was religion, and the Brothers and Sisters
who were pushing and shoving me shouted ecstatically
that God had me; it was obvious that I was suffering,
and suffering has always been accepted as a
true sign of holiness.</p>

<p>But it was not God and it was not religion. It was
the music. Behind me came my brother, sedately, as
he always did things. He went calmly to join the godly;
for him there was no pushing and no pulling; when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
saw me being dragged into the aisle he simply got to his
feet and followed. I have always suspected that he
went along merely to take care of me; frequently he did
that. He was continually fighting my battles, and if he
did not like the nicknames that the other boys fastened
onto me, he protested so fiercely that the name was transferred
to his shoulders. They tried to call me “Cat”
for some obscure reason when I was a boy, and my
brother did not like it; and to this day he is “Cat” Asbury
in Farmington.</p>

<p>Brother McConnell grabbed my hand and shook it
clammily when I reached the mourners’ bench, and I
was shoved into a seat. Immediately a Brother plopped
down beside me, an old man whom I had known all my
life, and who I knew perfectly well was an old skinflint
and a hypocrite, a Sunday Christian. He put his arm
around my shoulders and began to pray, crying down
my neck and shouting that another soul had been saved,
calling on the Lord to witness the good work that he
was doing. I half expected him to say: “Give me
credit, God; give me credit!” And all the time I was
wishing to God that the band would stop playing; my
nerves were being shattered by the constant and steady
beat of the hymns, and the penetrating wail of the
violin and the thunder of the organ.</p>

<p>And at last it did stop. There was silence in the
church, except that here and there someone was writhing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
and moaning. But the shouting had ceased.
Brother McConnell had his benches full, all of his workers
had each a convert to work upon, and he decided
to call it a day and save whatever sinners remained
in the congregation for another night. So printed cards
were passed around, which we were to sign, indicating
the church we would join. Then the evangelist said
for all of us who had been baptized to sit down. My
brother and I sat down.</p>

<p>With no music to upset me I began to think, and the
more I thought, the angrier I got. I was ashamed; I
boiled with fury and I wanted to smash the Brothers
and Sisters in their smug faces. But I was just a boy
and I was afraid. It was at this point that my younger
brother came down the aisle and tapped me on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Hey!” he said. “Mary said to stand up; you
haven’t been baptized!”</p>

<p>“You tell her,” I said, “to go to hell!”</p>

<p>Luckily none of the Brothers and Sisters heard me,
so I escaped special prayers. I signed my card, agreeing
to become a member of the Southern Methodist
church, and soon afterward I was released. My sister
and my two brothers went home, but I sneaked away
and went down to the Post Office, where I found
another boy whose influence with a bartender was sufficient
to get us a drink. I went with him to a saloon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
not far from the old Grand Leader building, and there
I had my first drink, a gin rickey, and when the bartender
would not sell me another I gave a Negro cart-driver
a half-dollar and he bought me a bottle of
squirrel whisky which I consumed in the vacant lot behind
the Odd Fellows’ Hall. I got gloriously drunk,
and about three o’clock in the morning I staggered home
and up the stairs to the room which I shared with my
brother. I awakened him, trying to undress, and he
asked:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p>“Hell’s fire, Emmett!” I replied. “I’ve got religion.”</p>

<p>I went to the preacher’s house the next day so Brother
Jenkins could sprinkle holy water upon my head and
mumble a prayer, and later, having thus been baptized,
I joined the church, but I joined with my tongue in my
cheek and a sneer in my heart. I have never seen anything
in any church since that would impel me to remove
either my tongue or the sneer. And when I admitted
publicly that I had been converted and was now
a good and faithful servant of the Methodist God, I said
to myself: “Over the left.” That was our way of saying:
“I am like hell!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">NOTES ON A SAINTED RELATIVE</h2>
</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>I went downtown the next morning after I had become
a certified one hundred per cent. convert, and
was met by swarms of Brothers and Sisters who overwhelmed
me with congratulations, and regaled me with
tales of their own experiences when they saw God, and
of the temptations that the Devil would now prepare for
me. It seemed that I was not yet safe; I had, so far as
they knew, accepted God and was one of His chosen
children, although not a Jew, but He would still permit
Satan to have his way with me upon occasion. I was
instructed to walk humbly and with downcast eyes, not
daring to look up lest I be led into sin. The Brothers,
gloating the while, seemed especially anxious that the
handsome young virgins of the town should not induce
me to tread the scarlet paths of wickedness; the Sisters
were more concerned with the Drink Demon, and the
evils of playing cards and dancing. One Sister stopped
me in front of Morris Brothers’ store and, beating time
with her hand, lifted her voice in song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Yield not to temptation,</div>
<div class="verse">For yielding is sin.”</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>And so on.</p>

<p>Nearly all of them seemed to be obsessed by the conviction
that at last I had done something to justify my
ancestry; that Bishop Asbury had looked down from
the Heavenly Mansions upon Brother McConnell’s revival
meeting and had approved the manner in which my
conversion had been brought about.</p>

<p>“The Bishop is proud of you to-day, Herbie,” said
one devout Brother who sold shoddy clothing at high
prices. “Last night was a great night for God and
the Bishop.”</p>

<p>I did not ask him how he knew that Bishop Asbury
was proud of me, nor did I inquire into the source of
his information that the conversion, by force, of a
fourteen-year-old boy was a great thing for God. I
merely said: “Yes, sir,” and went my way. But it
went on day after day; everybody in town, it seemed,
had a word to say about the pride that now swelled the
heart of the Bishop as he went about among the virgins
of Heaven and lolled on a cloud strumming his golden
harp and producing platinum and diamond music. I
got very tired of it, and finally, to one old Sister who
had apparently thought of nothing else for a week, I
said:</p>

<p>“Oh, to hell with the Bishop!”</p>

<p>What blasphemy! She gasped and hurried away,
and long before I reached home she had telephoned and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
told my mother that I had blasphemed and cried out
against God. Naturally, my mother was worried; she
thought from the tale told to her that I had gone up
and down the streets of the town shouting defiance of
God and yelling open praise of the Devil and all his
works. But I told her the whole story, and she listened
without comment, and when I had finished all she said
was this:</p>

<p>“Well, don’t say ‘hell’ to them.”</p>

<p>I think that was the last I ever heard from my mother
about religion, and from my father I heard even less.
Once my mother asked me to read the Bible, and although
of course I had already done so, I read it again.
I read it twice, from the first absurdity of Genesis to
the final fairy tale of Revelation. But I found nothing
in it that caused me to believe that it was an inspired
work, and nothing that proved, to me, the correctness of
the pretensions so freely made by the Sisters and
Brothers and the Preachers that they, and they alone,
were the representatives and accredited agents of Jesus
Christ on earth. And the sermons that I heard thereafter—the
Preachers selected single verses from the
Bible and constructed elaborate harangues around them—struck
me more forcibly than ever as the trashiest
sort of poppycock and balderdash. I was no longer
afraid of the Hell that they pictured with such avidity,
and I no longer thrilled to their tales of the magnificence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
of Heaven, although of course to a growing boy the
presence of so many virgin angels, all apparently willing
and available, was interesting. But none of them
preached the religion of Christ; they preached hatred
and revenge. They held out slight hope of reward; instead
they were prophets of torture, promising eternal
punishment for petty crimes.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>It was about this time, also, that I began to investigate
the glories of Bishop Asbury, and to make such inquiries
as I could into his saintly virtues. We had in
our library the Bishop’s Journals in three volumes, and
we had also two or three volumes of biography, all of
which I read. In later years I have read many others.
Probably twenty or thirty books, in one form or another,
have been written about Bishop Asbury, and I think that
I have gone pretty thoroughly into most of them. But
most of them are senseless if not downright idiotic; they
were written by preachers and published by the Methodist
Church, and the whole slant is religious. They
are based on the assumption that a Preacher and a
Bishop must of necessity be a holy man, and that all
the little idiosyncrasies and faults that give a clue to
the real character of the man, are but manifestations
of the fight between God and Satan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>From an ecclesiastical point of view there can be no
question of Bishop Asbury’s greatness, for there have
been few men who have left a more definite imprint on
American religious culture. There were fewer than
500 Methodists in America when he came here in 1771;
when he died there were 214,000, with good churches
and great influence. He had completed the church
organization according to his own ideas, ignoring to a
large extent the plans of John Wesley as set forth by
Thomas Rankin and Thomas Coke, and he had assumed
as much power as a Pope of Rome. As a religious organizer
he has had few equals, and it is a great pity
that he did so much unnecessary organizing, and that his
amazing genius should have flowered in such a futile
and preposterous creation as the present-day Methodist
Church; a great pity that he could not have developed
a more flexible creed, one that would have grown as
the world grew, instead of standing stock-still and viewing
the universe with intolerant suspicion, with constant
bickerings about the wishes of God and yelping appeals
to the Almighty to damn somebody.</p>

<p>But statistically Bishop Asbury is even greater. He
preached his first sermon in America at Philadelphia
on the day he set foot on this continent, in October, 1771,
and delivered his final pronouncement against sin on
his deathbed, when, propped upon his pillows, he expounded
the twenty-first chapter of Revelation. In these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
forty-five years he preached some 17,000 sermons, and
probably 20,000 in his whole life, for he began preaching
when he was about fifteen or sixteen, some three
years after his conversion. The number of words that
he uttered for the Lord is simply incalculable; there is
no telling how far they would reach if they could be
laid end to end.</p>

<p>In their methods of preaching and in their intolerance
the preachers of my boyhood, of other sects as well
as Methodists, were devout and faithful followers of
Bishop Asbury. The bellowing evangelist of the Billy
Sunday and Lincoln McConnell type is his lineal ecclesiastical
descendant. He preached always at the top
of his voice, for he had great faith in exhortation, and
to him the good sermon was the noisy sermon; even to-day
the Preacher who rants and raves is the one who
is regarded by his flock as nearest to God. When
Bishop Asbury was not preaching he was praying; he
rose every morning at four o’clock and prayed and read
the Bible until six, when he breakfasted and set forth
on his travels. He would not sleep more than six hours
a night because Wesley had decided that six hours was
enough. One day a week he fasted, and part of another
day, punishing his flesh for the greater glory of
the Lord.</p>

<p>This love of self-inflicted punishment affected his
whole life. As a boy he was moody and sensitive; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
appears to have been of the type that complains constantly
that he is being “picked on.” He was introspective,
finding his greatest joy in self-pity, and he was
never happy, as we used to say in Missouri, unless he
was miserable. His playmates in the little English
school near Birmingham called him “parson” because
of his pious lugubriousness, and when the teacher beat
him or something happened to cross him he sought solace
in prayer.</p>

<p>References to his numerous physical ailments begin
to appear in Bishop Asbury’s Journals about 1772,
when he was in his late twenties. He had never been
strong physically, and never after he came to America
was he in good health. He was apparently a hypochondriac,
with all the hypochondriac’s morbid delight
in recounting his symptoms; many pages of his Journals
are filled with them. He took enormous doses of
medicine, performed slight surgical operations upon
himself, and raised great blisters on the slightest provocation,
frequently blistering his whole body from throat
to abdomen. Once he preached a whole afternoon with
so many blisters that he was not able either to stand or
sit, for he had blistered not only the soles of his feet
but less refined portions of his anatomy also; he had
to be propped up in the pulpit, where he raved and
ranted for hour after hour, saving many sinners. He
took no care of himself whatever, riding horseback<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
through snowstorms and rainstorms with biting pains in
his chest, and with his stomach and throat filled with
ulcers, feverish from pain and religion.</p>

<p>All of these things he notes in his Journals with great
gusto, and gives long lists of the medicines he took and
the measures he employed to combat his sickness. Tartar
emetic was his favorite remedy, and of this he
swallowed enormous quantities. For an ulcerated
throat he used a gargle of “sage tea, honey, vinegar and
mustard, and after that another gargle of sage, tea,
alum, rose leaves and loaf sugar to strengthen the parts.”
Another favorite remedy was a diet, as he called it,
made from this remarkable formula: “one quart of
hard cider, one hundred nails, a handful of snake root,
a handful of pennell seed, a handful of wormwood.”
He boiled this concoction from a quart to a pint, and
drank a wineglass of it each morning before breakfast
for ten days, meanwhile using no butter, milk or meat.
He notes in his Journal that “it will make the stomach
very sick.” It will. I brewed the drink once, and I
had as soon drink dynamite; bootleg gin is nectar by
comparison.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that Bishop Asbury’s physical
condition had a great deal to do with his extraordinary
piety, for it is true that most of the religious
leaders have had many things wrong with their bodies,
and that the sicker a man is, the more religious he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
likely to be. A man who is healthy and normal mentally
and physically seldom becomes fanatically religious.
True, healthy men sometimes become monks
and preachers, but except in rare instances such men are
comparatively moderate in their views. And generally
they do themselves very well in a material way, especially
if they become monks.</p>

<p>It was once my journalistic duty to make a daily visit
to a Franciscan monastery in Quincy, Illinois, and the
good brothers remain a high light in a somewhat drab
period. Jovial and pot-bellied, they were veritable
Friar Tucks in brown bathrobes, extraordinarily hearty
eaters and drinkers, and not even at pre-Volstead banquets
have I ever received as much free food and drink
as from the good Franciscans. It was easy to see why
such men as these went in for religion, but it is not so
easy to understand the motive of the Protestant minister.
The earthly rewards are nothing to speak of, and what
with evolution and one thing and another, he can no
longer be certain that there is a Heaven to go to.</p>

<p>The Franciscans were fascinating spectacles as they
padded on their sandaled feet through the gardens of
the monastery and along the graveled paths that led to
the church next door. I became particularly fond of
Brother John—I think they called him Brother John,
anyhow I did—who might have stepped from the pages
of Boccaccio. He was the press representative of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
monastery; he always answered my ring, and through
the bars of the door I could see him, waddling genially
down the corridor, puffing and rattling his keys. It always
seemed to me that Brother John was miscast;
doubtless he lived a happy and carefree life, though perhaps
overly cluttered with prayer, but I thought it a
great pity that he could not have been an alderman.
And what a bartender he would have made! His
paunch would have elected him a City Father, and his
fund of stories would have got him a job in any first-class
barroom. But possibly he has reformed and is
now leading some such useful life.</p>

<p>Brother John made but one effort to convert me and
induce me to join the Catholic Church, and when I said
“Bunk!” he stopped immediately and said that inasmuch
as I would undoubtedly go to Hell he would still take
advantage of my reportorial capacity to get a little publicity
for the Church before that unfortunate event occurred.
But there was no tolerance in the attitude of
my reverend relative, the Bishop. His outstanding
characteristic was intolerance; it shows in a hundred
different acts of his career; he was arbitrary and
domineering. Anyone who was well dressed or who
bore any outward signs of prosperity was offensive in
his sight; he preached the gospel of poverty and self-denial,
and believed that all pleasure was wicked and
that self-inflicted suffering was heavenly bliss. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
imperious and scornful of restraint and opposition;
what he said was true he thought was true, and that
was all there was to it. When men differed with him
they were wrong, and he had no disposition to reopen
any question which he had once settled in his mind.
He believed that he was appointed by God to rule the
Methodists in America, and that he was a legitimate
successor of the Apostles. In 1801 he wrote:</p>

<p>“I will tell the world what I rest my authority on;
first, divine authority; second, seniority in America;
third, the election of the General Conference; fourth,
my ordination by Thomas Coke, Philip William Otterbein,
Richard Whatcoat and Thomas Vasey; fifth, because
the signs of an Apostle have been seen in me.”</p>

<p>Divine authority and the signs of an Apostle!</p>

<p>Yet his steadfast belief that he was so appointed was
one of the secrets of his power and influence, which were
greater than that of any other churchman of his time.
We are even yet feeling their effects, and we shall continue
to feel them. There seems to be no hope, what
with Boards of Temperance, Prohibition and Public
Morals and similar intolerant activities, that the Methodist
Church will ever become more worthy of respect
than it was in his day. Indeed, it grows worse and
worse.</p>

<p>Another prime factor in Bishop Asbury’s extraordinary
piety, as can be seen by the entries in his Journals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
and by a study of the biographies written by other
clergymen, was his terrific mental turmoil. Throughout
his whole life his mind whirled like a pinwheel; he
was constantly in what, back in Missouri, we used to
call a “terrible state.” About the time he began to be
ill he started referring to himself as “Poor Francis,”
and thereafter that was the dominant note of his life.
He pitied himself because of his physical ills, and then
dosed himself with horrid medicines, and with bleedings
and blisterings, making his ailments more painful
and himself an object of greater pity. He tortured himself
thus physically, and flogged his mind with constant
thoughts of his unworthiness; he was continually groveling
before God, beseeching the Almighty to put temptation
in his path. These extracts taken at random from
his Journals show the trend of his thought:</p>

<p>“I do not sufficiently love God nor live by faith.</p>

<p>“I must lament that I am not perfectly crucified with
God.</p>

<p>“I feel some conviction for sleeping too long.</p>

<p>“My heart is grieved and groaneth for want of more
holiness.</p>

<p>“Unguarded and trivial conversation has brought a
degree of spiritual deadness.</p>

<p>“My conscience reproves me for the appearance of
levity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“A cloud rested on my mind, which was occasioned by
talking and jesting. I also feel at times tempted to impatience
and pride of heart.</p>

<p>“My heart is still depressed for want of more religion.</p>

<p>“Were I to stand on my own merit, where should I
go but to hell?</p>

<p>“Here I received a bitter pill from one of my greatest
friends [referring to his last letter from John Wesley].
Praise the Lord for my trials also! May they
be sanctified.”</p>

<p>Bishop Asbury preached the same doctrine of personal
conversion and sanctification that is preached by
present-day Methodist ministers, and he sought this blissful
state for himself with frenzied zealousness. At
times he thought he had entered into what he called the
full fruition of a life with God; at other times he
fancied himself given up to Satan. The older he grew,
the gloomier and more introspective he became, and
like most of the other great religionists he had a pronounced
streak of melancholia. He had alternating
periods of exaltation and depression; he was either
soaring the heights of religious ecstasy or floundering
in the depths of sin and despair. He did not seem able
to find any middle ground in which he could obtain a
measure of peace and contentment; occasionally in his
Journals he noted that he was happy in God and at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
peace, but the next entry showed him groaning in great
vexation of spirit, crying out a doubt of the value of his
religious life. He yearned for a constant religious
thrill, and mourned because he could not satisfy his
yearning.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">DIVERSIONS OF AN ABANDONED SINNER</h2>
</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>Almost immediately after my conversion, or at least
as soon as it had become noised about that I had
consigned my holy relative to what some of our more
finicky Sisters, unable to bring themselves to say
“Hell,” referred to coyly as “the bad place,” I abandoned
myself to a life of sin and became a total
spiritual loss in the eyes of all Farmington except members
of my immediate family and certain of my intimate
friends who collaborated with me in various
wicked but pleasant enterprises. That is to say, I cast
aside the taboos and the inhibitions that religion had
thrown about me, and became for the first time in my
life a normal boy. I existed simply to play and raise
hell generally, and for some curious reason the activity
which gave me the most pleasure was throwing rocks
at the church or in some manner interrupting the service.</p>

<p>It was not long before even the most hopeful had
ceased their talk of sending me to a theological school
and fitting me to carry on the family labors, for I began
to smoke cigarettes, play cards, swear, drink when
I could find a bartender willing to ignore the law forbidding
the sale of liquor to a minor, and to cock an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
appreciative and appraising eye at the girls. It was
then agreed that it was too late to do anything with me
or for me, and on the Sunday morning that I mounted
my new bicycle and rode brazenly past the Southern
Methodist church as the Brothers and Sisters filed with
bowed heads into the edifice for worship, I was consigned
body and soul to the sizzling pits of Hell.</p>

<p>I suffered a great deal of physical agony before I
learned to smoke cigarettes, and it was some time before
I learned to blow smoke through my nose with the
nonchalant ease affected by the group of older boys
and young men who loafed in Doss’s barber shop and
around the Post Office Building and McKinney’s peanut
and popcorn machine. My older brother had learned
a year or so before, and he frequently made himself
very offensive to me by boasting that he could smoke
a whole package of Sweet Caporals or Drums without
becoming ill. I yearned to try, but he would not give
me a cigarette, and neither would any of the other boys,
and my finances were in such shape that I could not
purchase any. And, of course, such wicked things
could not be purchased and charged to my father; I
could have charged a plug of chewing tobacco to him,
but not cigarettes.</p>

<p>But one day I was loafing hopefully in McKinney’s
when my brother came in and produced a dime that he
had amassed by laborious work chopping wood at home,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
and bought a package of Sweet Caporal Little Cigars.
These were really nothing but cigarettes wrapped with
tobacco instead of paper, but they resembled a cigar
and were thought to be infinitely more stylish and manly
than the ordinary cigarette. I asked him for one, and
he said he would not give one to John the Baptist himself.
But I persisted, and followed him home, aghast
at his determination to hide behind the barn and smoke
the whole package one after the other.</p>

<p>“I’ll light one from the end of the other,” he boasted.</p>

<p>Finally as we came opposite Brother Nixon’s house
just south of Elmwood Seminary, he relented and very
carefully opened the box and handed me a Little Cigar.
It was a great moment. The yard of Elmwood Seminary
fairly swarmed with girl students, including the
young lady who at the time represented everything that
was desirable in the female sex, and I visioned their
cries of startled admiration as I passed, puffing nonchalantly,
blowing smoke from my nose and perhaps
from my ears.</p>

<p>I had no doubt of my ability to handle the innocent-looking
Little Cigar; indeed, at that time I considered
no problem insurmountable. My brother instructed me
to fill my mouth with smoke and then take a long, deep
breath, and after that blow the smoke out gently and
slowly, holding the Little Cigar between the first and
second finger and crooking the little finger as we did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
when we drank tea or coffee, that being a mark of gentility
and refinement. As we came in front of the old
Clardy homestead less than half a block from the Seminary
I struck a match and applied it to the end of the
Little Cigar, while my brother watched anxiously and
from time to time gave me advice. I puffed as he directed.</p>

<p>“Got a mouthful?” he asked.</p>

<p>Unable to speak, my cheeks bulging, I nodded.</p>

<p>“Now take a long breath.”</p>

<p>But, alas, I did not breathe; I swallowed, and while
the smoke penetrated me and spread throughout my interior,
it did not take the correct route. I began to
strangle, and my brother got excited.</p>

<p>“Blow it out, you damn fool!” he cried. “You’ll
choke!”</p>

<p>I did choke. I did even worse; I became very ill,
and the spectacle which so intrigued the young ladies of
the Seminary that day was not that of a young gentleman
going nonchalantly to Hell by the cigarette route.
Instead, they saw a very sick boy rolling on the sidewalk
trying desperately to stem a distressing internal
upheaval.</p>

<p>It was several days later before I had enough courage
to try again, and I debated within myself whether or
not God had caused me to be so ill in order to show
me that smoking was a sin. But I had definitely committed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
myself to the Devil, so a few days later I begged
a dime from my father and bought a package of Drums
and another of Sweet Caporals, the two most popular
brands of cigarettes. With these, and a supply of
matches, I went behind the barn. I made a neat pile
of sawdust to lie upon, and there I remained the whole
afternoon, smoking one cigarette after another. I was
terribly ill at first, but gradually improved until the
last three or four gave me no trouble. I did not have
much appetite for dinner that night, but I had conquered
the cigarette and I felt a glow of pride at the
fact that I had got a very good start in the direction of
the bad place.</p>

<p>The basis of my overwhelming desire to smoke cigarettes
was the fact that cigarette-smoking when I was a
boy in Farmington was one of the major sins. It
ranked with adultery and just a little ahead of murder
and theft. The Preachers called them coffin nails and
delivered violent sermons against them, and every once
in a while an evangelist would come to town with
medical charts showing the effect of tobacco upon the
interior human organs. But the fact that it was bad
physically for growing boys was seldom stressed at all;
we were impressed instead with the fact that God thought
it a sin to smoke cigarettes, although it did not appear
that it was a sin for the tobacconist to sell them. That
was business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>Many efforts were made to reform me after I had
begun to smoke. My mother said she had hoped
I wouldn’t, but that was all she said, and my father
said he did not give a hoot whether I smoked or not,
but that he hoped I would not be a fool and overdo it.
He himself had learned the art of chewing tobacco when
he was a boy of seven in Mississippi, and so far as I
have ever been able to learn, God had never called him
to account. He died at the age of seventy-nine, suddenly,
and a slab of plug-cut was in his pocket. It is
impossible for me to believe that God refused him entrance
into whatever Heaven there may be on account of
his habit, which he thoroughly enjoyed.</p>

<p>But the Preachers and the Brothers and Sisters did
not agree with my parents, nor would they admit that it
was none of their business. On the contrary, they said
that it was the Lord’s business, and since they were the
duly accredited agents of the Lord, appointed by Him to
lead Farmington into the paths of righteousness, it was
their business also. When Brother Fontaine was our
Methodist pastor he did not look with disfavor upon
chewing, because he himself was seldom without a chew
and presumably had an indulgence from God, but he
looked upon the cigarette as an invention of the Devil.
In this view he was upheld by the Ladies’ Aid Society
and the Farmington branch of the Women’s Christian
Temperance Union. And the W. C. T. U., with the possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
exception of the Methodist Board of Temperance,
Prohibition and Public Morals, was and is the world’s
best example of an organization maintained for the sole
purpose of minding other people’s business.</p>

<p>The hullabaloo over my smoking only made me more
determined to smoke until my insides turned black and
I was called home by Satan and transformed into a
tobacco demon. For that reason I probably smoked too
much. As a matter of principle I always lighted a
cigarette just in front of the Southern Methodist church,
and in front of the home of my uncle, who was an
enemy of anything that provided physical pleasure and
contentment. I always smoked another as I passed the
Northern Methodist church, the scene of the McConnell
revival orgy, and still another in front of the Christian
church, in memory of Brother Nations. That was four
in half a mile, and of course was too many, but sometimes
I was not permitted to finish all of them. Frequently
a Brother or a Sister, seeing me thus flaunting
my sin on the public highway, snatched the nasty thing
from my mouth and gave me a lecture that dripped religion
and was principally concerned with the fate of
boys who defied God and Jesus Christ by smoking
cigarettes. One Sister asked me:</p>

<p>“Where did you get the vile things?”</p>

<p>I told her that I had bought them at her husband’s
store, and she shrieked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“You saucy, blasphemous boy!”</p>

<p>But on that particular occasion I was not lectured, although
she telephoned my mother that I had been impudent
to her. My mother told her it was too bad.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>I learned to play pinochle when I was about fifteen,
only a few months after I had become an accomplished
cigarette fiend and was generally considered a fine prospect
for Satan, and thereafter was a regular participant
in the game that went on every night in the back room
of Karl Schliesser’s cigar factory. This was a notable
den of evil, and while religion had me in its clutches
I thought black magic was practiced there, and that its
habitués had communion with the Devil; among us it
was believed that God had doubtless never heard of the
place or He would have destroyed it with a withering
blast of lightning. It was frequented by Germans and
other low forms of life, and they were principally
Catholics and Lutherans, with a sprinkling of renegade
Protestants like myself. The Brothers and Sisters held
the opinion that if this crowd had a God at all he must
have been a very queer being, for bursts of ribald laughter
came from Schliesser’s back room, and there was
card-playing, and I do not doubt that occasionally someone
gambled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>Schliesser was the Town Socialist, and was looked
upon with grave suspicion by the better element, as in
those days it was generally recognized that a Socialist
was an emissary of the Devil. But the Brothers and
Sisters and the Preachers looked with even more suspicion
upon Victor Quesnel. In this attitude they had
the support of the Catholics. Victor Quesnel was born
in France, but he had lived in Farmington for many
years. He frequently quoted Voltaire, and appeared
to believe that a man’s religion and his belief or disbelief
in God was a matter of his own personal taste,
and he was therefore regarded as an atheist. As a matter
of fact he was probably more truly religious than
most of the pious Brothers and Sisters; the principal
difference was that he did not try to compel everyone he
met to embrace his creed.</p>

<p>Frequently, and without particular regard as to who
heard him, Quesnel discussed the advantages of sleeping
naked, or, as we say in present-day journalism, undraped.
That was his hobby. He said he thought it
was a healthful practice, that he slept better without clothing,
and that come what might he was going to continue
to sleep that way. This was considered heathenish doctrine;
some of our finest church members owned stores
in which they sold nightgowns and pajamas, and it was
felt that Quesnel’s attitude was not only a direct affront
to God but was also injurious to business. Moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
the Brothers and Sisters did not consider such a practice
modest; there were scores, perhaps hundreds of
people in Farmington who had never in their lives removed
all of their clothing. Once at a meeting of the
Ladies’ Aid Society I heard an old Sister say that she
had reached the age of sixty and had never been entirely
undressed; and that when she bathed she kept her
eyes closed as she applied the sponge to her body. A
great deal of juicy conversation could be overheard at
these Ladies’ Aid meetings by a bright young lad who
knew where the best keyholes were located.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Sunday was much more enjoyable after I had become
a sinner and had left Sunday school and the Church to
whatever fate the Lord had in store for them. I arose
a little later, had a leisurely breakfast and a refreshing
quarrel or fight with my brothers and sister, and then
went leisurely to my room and as leisurely put on my
Sunday suit, with no intention of removing it until I retired
for the night. Curiously enough, as soon as I
quit going regularly to church and Sunday school I
began to wear my Sunday suit all day, and the little
voice that I had in the selection of this garment I
raised in hopeful pleas for loud checks and glaring
colors. No longer did I wish to clothe myself in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
sombre blacks suitable for church wear and religious
activity; I desired to blossom and bloom in the more
violent and pleasant colors of Hell.</p>

<p>Once arrayed in my Sunday suit, I left the house, a
cigarette dangling from my lower lip, and my hat, carefully
telescoped in the prevailing mode, sitting just so
on the side of my head. I tried to time my march
downtown so that I would reach Elmwood Seminary just
as the young lady students resident there marched across
the street, after Sunday school, from the Presbyterian
church; they were not permitted to remain at the church
during the fifteen or twenty-minute interval because they
attracted such hordes of feverish boys intent upon
everything but religion. Usually I reached the scene
in time, and leaned nonchalantly against the Seminary
fence, puffing vigorously and ostentatiously on a cigarette
and winking at various and sundry of the girls as
they passed in their caps and gowns.</p>

<p>For these smart-aleck activities I was presently placed
upon the school’s black list and was not permitted to call
upon the one night each month allotted to such social
intercourse, but as I soon learned to climb a rope ladder
this did not annoy me greatly. Anyhow, calling night
at Elmwood Seminary was not very exciting. The procedure
was to place a dozen or so chairs about a big
room, in pairs but with at least twelve inches between
them, in which sat the girls and their callers. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
center sat a gimlet-eyed teacher, constantly ready with
Biblical and other uplifting quotations and seeing to
it that nothing scandalous occurred. From eight to ten
the caller was permitted to engage his lady love in conversation,
but it was a rule that everything that was said
must be audible to the teacher on guard. Whisperings
and gigglings were taboo, and resulted in the young man
being placed on the black list, and forbidden thereafter
to darken the doors of the institution. But occasionally
the teacher relaxed her vigilance for a moment, providing
an opportunity to arrange a clandestine meeting.
That was the principal reason that the boys of Farmington
went to Elmwood on calling nights.</p>

<p>The regular Sunday incident of the Seminary girls
having been brought to a satisfactory and successful
conclusion, I went on downtown. I was very young
then, and I considered myself, in my Sunday suit, a very
striking and elegant figure. I thought of myself as a
parade, and felt morally certain that the eyes of every
girl were upon me, and that their hearts were fluttering
with amatory admiration. The Methodist church was
only two blocks south of the Presbyterian edifice, and
I generally reached it as the Sunday-school pupils
trooped out with their arms full of lesson pamphlets
and their souls full of salvation, Golden Texts and
catechisms. I regarded them pityingly, puffed vaingloriously
at my symbol of sin, and went on past the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
Christian church and the Northern Methodist church and
so to McKinney’s, the Post Office Building and the fascinating
popcorn and peanut machine.</p>

<p>In the winter time Doss’s barber shop was generally
open until noon so Billy Priester could shine the shoes
of the young bucks who proposed to defile the Sabbath
by gallivanting around with young hussies. It was a
favorite loafing place for all abandoned wretches who
did not care for the glory that was free in all churches.
But in summer we generally sat in front of McKinney’s
and the Post Office Building and, when finances permitted,
ate popcorn and peanuts, envying Riley Hough
as he hurried out now and then to attend to the machine
and stuff his mouth with popcorn before hastening back
into the store.</p>

<p>All of the young sinners of the town loafed there
during the church services, and at twelve o’clock noon
we rose in a body and walked down the street to Pelty’s
Book Store, where the Sunday papers were distributed.
The afternoons were devoted to baseball games and
amatory pursuits, and occasionally we went fishing.
But this was considered a Cardinal Sin, and was frowned
upon by even our liberal element; it was felt that it was
a desecration of God’s Day to drag one of His creatures
from the river with a cruel fishhook. On week
days, of course, fishing was all right, although a waste
of time, but on Sunday an expedition to Blumeyer’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Ford, or to Gruner’s Hole, was followed the next morning
by buzzing comment all over town, and only a grown
man could hope to indulge in such sinful adventures and
escape subsequent punishment.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>It was the custom of our pastors and pious brethren,
and of the professional sorcerers who were imported
from time to time to cast their spells and shoo the demons
away from our housetops, to proclaim loudly and
incessantly that our collective morals were compounded
of a slice of Sodom and a cut of Gomorrah, with an
extract of Babylon to flavor the sorry stew. They worried
constantly and fretfully over our amorous activities;
in their more feverish discourses appeared significant
references to the great difficulty of remaining
pure, and in effect they advised our young women to
go armed to the teeth, prepared to do battle in defense
of their virginity.</p>

<p>In Farmington and other small towns of the Middle
West this sort of thing was the principal stock in trade
of those who would lead their brethren to the worship
of the current god; the evangelist assured his hearers
that their town was overrun by harlots, and that brothels
abounded in which prominent men abandoned themselves
to shameful orgies, while church attendance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
dwindled, and collections became smaller and smaller,
and chicken appeared less and less frequently upon the
ministerial table. His tirades were generally in this
fashion:</p>

<p>“Shall we permit these painted daughters of Jezebel,
these bedizened hussies, to stalk the streets of this fair
city and flaunt their sin in the face of the Lord? Shall
we permit them to lure our sons and brothers into their
vile haunts and ply their nefarious trade in the very
shadow of the House of God? No! I say NO! Jesus
Christ must live in this town!”</p>

<p>Immediately everyone shouted “Amen, Brother!” and
“Praise the Lord!” But it was sometimes difficult to
determine whether the congregation praised the Lord for
inspiring the evangelist so courageously to defy the harlots,
or for permitting him to discover them. If the
Man of God could find them, why not the damned, too?
Certainly there were always many who wondered if the
brother had acquired any good addresses or telephone
numbers since coming to town. Not infrequently, indeed,
he was stealthily shadowed home by young men
eager to settle this question.</p>

<p>These charges and denunciations were repeated, with
trimmings, at the meetings for men only which were always
a most interesting feature of the revivals. At
similar gatherings for women, or ladies, as we called
them in small-town journalism, his wife or a devout Sister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
discussed the question from the feminine viewpoint.
What went on at these latter conclaves I do not know,
though I can guess, for I have often seen young girls
coming out of them giggling and blushing. The meetings
for men were juicy, indeed. The evangelist discussed
all angles of the subject, and in a very free manner.
His own amorous exploits before he was converted
were recited in considerable detail, and he
painted vivid word pictures of the brothels he had
visited, both as a paying client and in the course of his
holy work. Almost invariably they were subterranean
palaces hung with silks and satins, with soft rugs upon
the floor, and filled with a vast multitude of handsome
young women, all as loose as ashes. Having thus intimated,
with some smirking, that for many years he
was almost the sole support of harlotry, he became confidential.
He leaned forward and said:</p>

<p>“There are such Dens of the Devil right here in your
town!”</p>

<p>This was first-hand information, and immediately
there was a stir in the audience, many of his hearers
betraying an eagerness to be gone. But before they
could get away the evangelist thundered:</p>

<p>“Shall we permit them to continue their wicked practices?”</p>

<p>I always hoped to be present some day when the audience
forgot itself and answered that question with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
the thought that was so plainly in its mind, namely,
“Yes!” But, alas, I never heard it, although there was
much shouting of “Amen!” and “Glory to God!”
These meetings for men only were generally held in the
afternoon, and their net result was that the business of
the drug store increased immediately, and when night
fell bands of young good-for-nothings scurried hither
and yon about the town, searching feverishly for the
Dens of the Devil. They searched without fear, confident
that modern science would save them from any
untoward consequences, and knowing that no matter
what they did they would go to Heaven if they permitted
a preacher to intercede for them in the end,
or a priest to sprinkle them with holy water.</p>

<p>But the Dens of the Devil were not found, neither in
Farmington nor in any other small town in that region,
for the very good reason that they did not exist. The
evangelist did not know what he was talking about; he
was simply using stock blather which he had found by
experience would excite the weak-minded to both sexual
and religious emotions. He knew that when they were
thus upset they would be less likely to question his ravings—that
they would be more pliable in his hands and
easier to convert.</p>

<p>Our small towns were not overrun by harlots simply
because harlotry could not flourish in a small town.
It was economically impossible; there were not enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
cash customers to make the scarlet career profitable.
Also, the poor girls had to meet too much competition
from emotional ladies who had the professional spirit
but retained their amateur standing by various technicalities.
And harlots, like the rest of us, had to live;
they required the same sort of raiment and food that
sufficed their virtuous sisters; it was not until they died
that they wore nothing but the smoke of Hell and were
able to subsist on a diet of brimstone and sulphur.</p>

<p>Many men who in larger communities would have
patronized the professionals could not do so in a small
town. They could not afford to; it was too dangerous.
The moment a woman was suspected of being a harlot
she was eagerly watched by everyone from the mayor
down to the preachers, and the name of every man seen
talking to her, or even looking at her, went winging
swiftly from mouth to mouth, and was finally posted
on the heavenly bulletin board as that of an immoral
wretch. A house in which harlotry was practiced was
picketed day and night by small boys eager to learn the
forbidden mysteries, and by Brethren and Sisters hopefully
sniffing for sin. It was not possible for a harlot
to keep her clientèle secret, for the sexual life of a small
town is an open book, and news of amorous doings
could not travel faster if each had a tabloid newspaper.</p>

<p>Exact statistics, of course, are not available, but it
is probably true that no small American town has ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
harbored a harlot whose income from professional services
was sufficient to feed and clothe her. Few if any
such towns have ever been the abode of more than one
harlot at a time. When I was a boy every one had its
town harlot, just as it had its town sot (this, of course,
was before drunkards became extinct) and its town idiot.
But she was generally a poor creature who was employed
by day as a domestic servant and practiced her
ancient art only in her hours of leisure. She turned
to it partly for economic reasons, but chiefly because
of a great yearning for human companionship, which
she could obtain in no other way. She remained in it
because she was almost instantly branded a Daughter of
Satan, and shunned by good and bad alike. She seldom,
if ever, realized that she was doing wrong; her
moral standards were those of a bedbug. She thought
of harlotry in terms of new ribbons and an occasional
pair of shoes, and in terms of social intercourse; she
was unmoral rather than immoral, and the proceeds of
her profession, to her, were just so much extra spending
money.</p>

<p>Small-town men who occasionally visited the larger
cities, and there thought nothing of spending from ten
to fifty dollars in metropolitan brothels, were very
stingy in dealing with the town harlot. They considered
a dollar an enormous price for her, and frequently
they refused to give her anything. Many small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
communities were not able to support even a part-time
harlot; consequently some members of the craft went
from town to town, taking secular jobs and practicing
harlotry as a side line until driven out by the godly, or
until the inevitable business depression occurred. I
recall one who made several towns along the O. K.
Railroad in Northeastern Missouri as regularly as the
shoe drummers. Her studio was always an empty box
car on the town siding, and she had a mania for inscribing
in such cars the exact dates and hours of her
adventures, and her honoraria. It was not unusual
to find in a car some such inscription as this:</p>

<p class="center">“Ten <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, July 8. Fifty cents.”</p>

<p>These writings, scrawled in lead pencil or with a bit
of chalk, were signed “Box Car Molly.” Once, in a
car from which I had unloaded many heavy bags of
cement, I came across what seemed to be a pathetic bit
of very early, and apparently authentic, Box-Car-Molliana.
On the wall was this:</p>

<p class="center">“I was ruined in this car May 10.<br>
<br>
<span class="indentleft">“<span class="smcap">Box Car Molly.</span>”</span></p>

<p>Our town harlot in Farmington was a scrawny creature
called variously Fanny Fewclothes and Hatrack,
but usually the latter in deference to her figure. When
she stood with her arms outstretched she bore a remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
resemblance to the tall hatracks then in general
use in our homes, and since she was always most
amiable and obliging, she was frequently asked to pose
thus for the benefit of drummers and other infidels. In
time, she came to take a considerable pride in this accomplishment;
she referred to herself as a model, and
talked vaguely of abandoning her wicked life and going
to St. Louis, where she was sure she could make a
living posing for artists.</p>

<p>Six days a week Hatrack was a competent and more
or less virtuous drudge employed by one of our best
families, but Sunday was her day off, and she then, in
turn, offered her soul to the Lord and went to the
Devil. For the latter purpose she utilized both the
Masonic and Catholic cemeteries. Hatrack’s regular
Sunday-night parade, her descent from righteousness
into sin, was one of the most fascinating events of the
week, and promptly after supper those of us who did
not have engagements to take young ladies to church
(which was practically equivalent to publishing the
banns) went downtown to the loafing place in front of
the Post Office and waited impatiently.</p>

<p>On week days Hatrack turned a deaf ear to the
blandishments of our roués, but on Sunday night she was
more gracious. This, however, was not until she had
gone to church and had been given to understand, tacitly
but none the less clearly, that there was no room for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
her in the Kingdom of Heaven. Our Sunday-night
services usually began about eight o’clock, following
the meetings of the various young people’s societies.
At seven-thirty, regardless of the weather, the angular
figure of Hatrack could be discerned coming down the
hill from the direction of the cemeteries. She lived
somewhere in that section and worked out by the day.
She was always dressed in her best, and in her eyes was
the light of a great resolve. She was going to church,
and there was that in her walk and manner which
said that thereafter she was going to lead a better
life.</p>

<p>There was always a group of men waiting for
her around the Post Office. But although several muttered
“Here she comes!” it was not good form to
speak to her then, and she walked past them as if she
had not seen them. But they, with their wide knowledge
of the vagaries of the Agents of God, grinned hopefully
and settled down to wait. They knew she would
be back. She went on up the street past the Court
House and turned into the Northern Methodist church,
where she took a seat in the last row. All about her
were empty seats; if they were not empty when she got
there they were soon emptied. No one spoke to her.
No one asked her to come to Jesus. No one held out
a welcoming hand. No one prayed for her. No one
offered her a hymn book. At the protracted meetings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
and revivals, which she invariably attended, none of the
Brothers and Sisters tried to convert her; she was a
Scarlet Woman and belonged to the Devil. There was
no place for her in a respectable congregation. They
could not afford to be seen talking to her, even in
church, where God’s love, by their theory, made
brothers and sisters of us all.</p>

<p>It was pitiful to watch her; she listened to the Word
with such rapt attention; she sang the hymns with such
fanatical fervor, and she so yearned for the comforts
of that barbaric religion and the blessings of easy intercourse
with decent people. But she never got them.
From the Christians and their God she got nothing but
scorn. Of all the sinners in our town Hatrack would
have been easiest to convert; she was so pathetically
eager for salvation. If a Preacher, or a Brother, or a
Sister, had so much as spoken a kind word to her she
would have dropped to her knees and given up her
soul to the Methodist God. And her conversion, in all
likelihood, would have been permanent, for she was not
mentally equipped for a struggle against the grandiose
improbabilities of revealed religion. If someone had
told her, as I was told, that God was an old man with
long whiskers, she would not have called Him “Daddy,”
as some of her more flippant city sisters might have
done; she would have accepted Him and gloried in Him.</p>

<p>But she was not plucked from the burning, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
workers for the Lord would have nothing to do with
her, and by the end of the service her eyes had grown
sullen and her lip had curled upward in a sneer. Before
the final hymn was sung and the benediction pronounced
upon the congregation, she got to her feet and
left the church. None tried to stop her; she was not
wanted in the House of God. I have seen her sit alone
and miserably unhappy while the Preacher bellowed a
sermon about forgiveness, with the whole church rocking
to a chorus of sobbing, moaning amens as he told
the stories of various Biblical harlots, and how God
had forgiven them.</p>

<p>But for Hatrack there was no forgiveness. Mary
Magdalene was a saint in Heaven, but Hatrack remained
a harlot in Farmington. Every Sunday night
for years she went through the same procedure. She
was hopeful always that someone would speak to her
and make a place for her, that the Brothers and Sisters
who talked so volubly about the grace and the mercy
of God would offer her some of the religion that they
dripped so freely over everyone else in town. But they
did not, and so she went back down the street to the
Post Office, swishing her skirts and brazenly offering
herself to all who desired her. The men who had been
waiting for her, and who had known that she would
come, leered at her and hailed her with obscene speech
and gesture. And she gave them back leer for leer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
meeting their sallies with giggles, and motioning with
her head toward the cemeteries.</p>

<p>And so she went up the hill. A little while later a
man left the group, remarking that he must go home.
He followed her. And a moment after that another
left, and then another, until behind Hatrack was a line
of men, about one to a block, who would not look at one
another, and who looked sheepishly at the ground when
they met anyone coming the other way. As each man
accosted her in turn Hatrack inquired whether he was a
Protestant or a Catholic. If he was a Protestant she
took him into the Catholic cemetery; if he was a Catholic
they went into the Masonic cemetery.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>I fell a willing victim to the wiles of the Rum Demon
on the night of my conversion, and thereafter, in common
with other boys of the town who were aflame with
revolt against the religious taboos which had so oppressed
us, I drank whenever I could obtain the liquor.
This was not often, because I seldom had any money and
it was difficult to find a bartender who would sell a
drink to a minor. The eagle eye of the W. C. T. U.
was constantly upon him. But occasionally the darkies
would buy for us in return for one swig at the bottle,
and as often as possible we purchased by this means a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
pint or quart of whisky or gin. I did not drink because
I liked the taste of liquor, for I didn’t, and I do
not now, but I thought it was smart and manly to get
drunk.</p>

<p>And there was another, and a deeper reason. It
seemed to me that in the eyes of the Preachers and the
Brothers and Sisters a man could commit no more
heinous sin than to get tight; it was even worse than
smoking. Such being the case, I felt that it was incumbent
upon me to achieve that condition, and thereby
show them that I had no use for them and the things for
which they stood. And that was also the reason we
sang vulgar songs, and roared with gusto the parodies
on hymns that we learned from time to time. It was
our custom to get as drunk as possible and then group
ourselves about the pump in the courthouse yard, where
we bellowed ditties and parodies until the town marshal
or some outraged Brother or Sister stopped us.</p>

<p>There were few such songs that we did not sing; it
was at the pump, on a summer night, that I first heard
the “Song of Jack Hall.” It was taught to us by a
shoe drummer from St. Louis, who sang it with appropriate
gestures, and for a long time it was our
favorite song. The version that we sang was this—it
should be rendered with great gusto and feeling, and
the final line of each verse should be dragged from deep
down in the chest:</p>

<div class="indent">God damn their eyes.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The parodies on hymns that we sang were almost
innumerable, and were undoubtedly sung all over the
country by other boys who, in the eyes of their elders,
were only being smart-alecky, but who, like us, had a
deeper reason for the eagerness with which they paraded
their disrespect for the Church and for religion. It
was one of the few ways we knew to flaunt our sin, and
nothing pleased us more than to break up a church
service, or at least interrupt it, by bellowing at the top
of our voices some disreputable and unholy parody that
had reached us in one way or another.</p>

<p>One of our most enjoyable Sunday-night escapades
was to gather in a group outside a church window, and
sing a parody immediately after the choir and the congregation
inside had sung the hymn itself. We persisted
in this until finally the pastor of the Northern
Methodist church had Wint Jackson, the Night Marshal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
chase us away. We went without comment or objection
when Jackson ordered us to disperse, because he
had just killed a desperado named Yates, and we considered
him something of a hero; we thought that he
went about with his finger constantly in the trigger of
his revolver, and that the finger itched.</p>

<p>On this particular night the parody which made the
Methodist minister so angry, and swept from his mind
all thought of his Christian duty to turn the other cheek
for us to swat, was on “Oh, that will be glory for me.”
Our version went like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Oh, there will be no chicken for me,</div>
<div class="verse">No chicken for me, no chicken for me;</div>
<div class="verse">When all the preachers have gulped their share,</div>
<div class="verse">There’ll be no chicken, no chicken for me.</div>
</div></div>

<p>To give the proper swing to the tune, “gulped” must
be pronounced “gulluped.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the most celebrated of all the parodies, at
that time, was on the favorite old hymn, “At the Bar.”
We sang it thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">At the bar, at the bar,</div>
<div class="verse">Where I smoked my first cigar,</div>
<div class="indent">And the nickels and the dimes rolled away;</div>
<div class="verse">It was there, by chance,</div>
<div class="verse">That I ripped my Sunday pants,</div>
<div class="indent">And now I can wear them every day.</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>Another parodied “Nearer, My God, to Thee,” thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Nero, my dog, has fleas,</div>
<div class="verse">Nero has fleas;</div>
<div class="indent">Although I wash him clean,</div>
<div class="verse">Nero, my dog, has fleas.</div>
</div></div>

<p>And thus, to the tune of “Hallelujah, Thine the Glory”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Hellilujah, I’m a hobo,</div>
<div class="verse">Hellilujah, I’m a bum;</div>
<div class="verse">Hellilujah, give us a handout,</div>
<div class="verse">Revive us again.</div>
</div></div>

<p>There was also in circulation at that time a great
number of parodies on hymns in which mention was
made of Beecham’s Pills, the merits of which were emblazoned
on every barn and fence throughout the countryside.
I have heard that these parodies were circulated
by the Beecham Pill people themselves in response
to a plea of English churches for hymn books, but I do
not know if the story is true. One of our favorites of
this collection was the parody on “Hark, the herald
angels sing.” It went:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Hark, the herald Angels sing,</div>
<div class="verse">Beecham’s Pills are just the thing;</div>
<div class="verse">Peace on earth and mercy mild,</div>
<div class="verse">Two for man and one for child.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>To my long list of unhallowed but frequently pleasant
accomplishments I added, in my sixteenth summer,
journalism and dancing; I went to work on the Farmington
<i>Times</i> and learned to waltz and two-step, and on
occasion danced the Virginia Reel and the quadrille
with spirit and abandon if not with elegant grace. The
practice of journalism was not then, in all quarters,
considered a sin of the first magnitude; nor is it so
considered to-day except when various Preachers and
other goody-bodies find their names mentioned infrequently
and their daily denunciations ignored. It is
then the fashion to denounce the newspapers, and to
deplore the low plane to which the fourth estate has
fallen. But in Farmington in my youth the feeling
against the Sunday newspaper was so great that it was
felt generally that all journalism was at least slightly
tainted, and so I list it as a sin. So far as the financial
rewards go, it is even now nothing less than a crime.</p>

<p>There was no question about the sinfulness of dancing,
especially the round dances, as we used to call the
waltz and two-step. In some parts of the country exception
was made for the square dances, but everywhere
in my section of Missouri the waltz and two-step
were considered Steps toward Hell. I frequently heard
Preachers and Brothers and Sisters pronounce solemn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
judgment against young girls who indulged in such
heinous practices, and brand them before God and man
as abandoned scarlet women glorying in the unsanctified
embraces of wicked men. That was the way the
Preachers usually talked, too. One man in our town
was even criticized for waltzing with his wife.</p>

<p>Not only was the wicked waltz and the devilish two-step,
no matter how decorously performed, a Sunday
taboo in our town, but in our most religious families
it was taboo at all times, and several persons were dismissed
from church for participating in such orgies.
We had one Preacher who informed us that both Sodom
and Gomorrah were destroyed by God because their
inhabitants danced and for no other reason, and the
prediction was freely made that Farmington was destined
for the same dreadful end, and he intimated that
we would not even reap the resultant benefits of great
fame and publicity. His tirades were strikingly similar
to the ones that are being made every day now by the
Methodist Board of Temperance, Prohibition and Public
Morals against New York City and other centers of
sin.</p>

<p>As I have said, for many years the Presbyterians,
city slickers at heart, had a virtual monopoly of dancing
in Farmington. It was they who introduced the
waltz and the two-step, to the great horror of all of our
old women, both male and female, and it is they who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
must be held responsible when God sends His avenging
angels to blast and destroy. Occasionally a Baptist or
a Methodist backslid sufficiently to trip the light fantastic
toe, as I delighted to call it as a juvenile reporter
on the <i>Times</i>, but not often; generally the Presbyterians
alone thus flaunted their wickedness. But when God
failed to perform as expected, others became bold and
abandoned all caution, and when I left Farmington,
dancing was general and the town was obviously headed
straight for Hell. But even then there was very little
dancing done on Sunday night.</p>

<p>We had two newspapers in Farmington, the <i>Times</i> and
the <i>News</i>, the former owned by Mr. Theodore Fisher
and the latter by the Denman brothers, extraordinarily
devout members of the Northern Methodist church and
leaders in most of the town’s religious activities. Mr.
Fisher was a Presbyterian, a liberal at heart, but for
business reasons he was unable to do or say anything
to stem the tide of prying Puritanism. Both papers
were controlled by the churches of the town, and published
everything that the Preachers and the Brothers
and Sisters asked them to; as I grew older, Mr. Fisher
became more confidential and frequently expressed his
disgust at many things that went on in Farmington, but
he was powerless. If he had said a word in favor of a
more liberal attitude his paper would have had an even
more difficult time getting along, and Heaven knows it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
was hard enough as it was; Mr. Fisher frequently had to
spend all of Saturday morning collecting advertising
accounts so he could pay wages in the afternoon. But
the <i>News</i> was always very prosperous.</p>

<p>When I went into the newspaper business, or game, as
it is called in the motion pictures and the schools of
Journalism, I went in with the enthusiastic thoroughness
with which I had abandoned myself to a life of sin.
Mr. Fisher hired me at $2 a week, during the summer
vacation, to be the office devil, and for that princely
wage I built the fires each morning, swept the office,
carried copy, set type, distributed pi, kicked the job
press, cranked the gasoline engine on Thursdays, fed
the big roller press, folded the papers, wrote names on
them and carried them to the Post Office in sacks. And
I had many other duties besides.</p>

<p>These multitudinous activities sufficed me for a few
weeks, because in doing them, and in so being engaged
in journalistic practice, I had the same feeling that so
encouraged me when I danced or drank or smoked cigarettes;
I was confident that I was doing something of
which the righteous did not wholly approve. But later
I became ambitious. I wanted to be an editor. Only
God knows why, but I did. So I became an editor; indeed,
I became many editors. Using the small job
press and Mr. Fisher’s stock of vari-colored inks, I
printed cards informing the world that I was sporting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
editor, society editor, fire editor, crime editor, baseball editor,
football editor, financial editor, religious editor,
and barber-shop editor, this last because I purposed to
interview the customers in Doss’s barber shop.</p>

<p>Thus equipped, I felt able to handle any journalistic
problem that might confront me, and I spent my spare
time interviewing people and gathering items which, because
of the extreme godliness of our citizens, usually
consisted of nothing more exciting than announcements
that so-and-so was on the sick list, or had been on the
sick list and was now improving. When I asked a
banker if he knew any news I gravely presented
him with my financial-editor card; and when it became
my proud duty to interview my youthful idol and our
most famous citizen, Mr. Barney Pelty, the major-league
baseball pitcher, he learned by ocular proof that
I was both sporting editor and baseball editor, and as
such fully competent to transmit to type and to posterity
his deathless utterances. As I recall them, these were
generally that he would be in town to visit his relatives
or because some member of his family was on the sick
list, and would then return to St. Louis to take up again
the onerous duties of his profession. Once he predicted
that the Browns would win the pennant, and I wrote
this exclusive information with all the large and handsome
words at my command, but he was mistaken.</p>

<p>As time went on I became almost everything that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
was possible to be on the <i>Times</i>; I was printer, pressman,
reporter, mechanic, editor of this and that, and
what not. But I was never permitted to write editorials
or chronicle the doings of our best people. The <i>Times</i>
was passionately addicted to the Democrats, and each
week our editorial page trumpeted the widely known
and indisputable fact that the Republicans were a lot
of skunks. These blasts were written, and well written,
by Mr. Fisher himself, and my own share in the
good work was merely to put them into type, and occasionally
correct Mr. Fisher’s phraseology when I did
not think that he had expressed himself clearly. And
since these corrections were made at the case after the
proof had been corrected, they nearly always got
printed, sometimes with dire results. Once Mr. Fisher
wrote, in jovial vein, about the gaudy house in which a
certain political candidate resided, and I corrected it
to read “bawdy house,” holding that the latter was more
definitely descriptive.</p>

<p>Another member of Mr. Fisher’s family, who had
previously spoken to me pleasantly when she met me
on the street but who regarded me as nothing but hired
help after I had accepted employment, wrote about the
social activities of our first families on Columbia Street
and the second and third families in Doss’s Addition.
I was occasionally permitted to describe the pitiful doings
of the Catholics, the Lutherans and other curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
humans down near the ice plant, and the weekly dances
given by the abandoned young people at our chief
source of civic pride, the insane asylum. But the functions
of Society were obviously beyond the descriptive
powers of a mere printer’s devil. It was bad enough
that such a person had to set the type. Nevertheless I
attended these functions, and gained great comfort by inserting
my name in the list of those present, and by adding
the important and vital information that dainty and
delicious refreshments had been served and a good time
had by all. If it was a birthday party the host was
wished many happy returns of the day. It was my belief
at that time that it was against the law to publish an
account of a social event without so stating. It was not
always true; frequently the refreshments were not delicious
and no one had a good time, but in those days
I did not have that high regard for the truth that I have
since acquired through labors on the great metropolitan
journals; indeed, a night seldom passes now that I do
not ask myself: “Have I written the truth to-day?”
The answer, has, so far, eluded me. But Mr. Fisher,
and to an even greater extent the Brothers Denman, sole
owners of the <i>News</i>, frankly tried to please the advertisers
and the subscribers; there was not then that fine
spirit of independence which is such an essential part
of modern journalism.</p>

<p>I advanced rapidly on the <i>Times</i>, and eventually was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
receiving $7 a week and had appointed myself to so
many editorships that my cards filled two pockets. I was
satisfied, and probably would have remained so for some
years, but the end of my allotted time in Farmington
was drawing near. I went to Northeast Missouri to
visit relatives, and Mr. Fisher discharged me for over-staying
my leave. This was a terrific blow; it seemed
to me that my journalistic career had been cut off in the
flower of its youth. I went to work in a lumber yard,
and kept the job until the first carload of cement came
in. But after I had pulled and tugged at the ninety-eight-pound
sacks for ten hours I concluded that the
lumber business held out no glowing promise for a
young man who wished to retain his health and
have leisure for a reasonable amount of traffic with
Satan.</p>

<p>So I resigned and went to Quincy, Ill., where after
considerable negotiations I obtained a job as reporter on
the Quincy <i>Journal</i> and embarked on a career in daily
journalism. So far this has kept me in the cities, where
the opportunities for sin are vastly more numerous than
in the small towns, but where there is less sin in proportion
to the number of inhabitants. This is true despite
the horde of wailing prophets and professional
devil-chasers and snoopers whose principal occupation
is violent and false denunciation of every city large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
enough to have an electric-light plant. And in a city
one can, by diligent search, find a few people who will
admit that a man’s religion, or his lack of religion, is
his own affair.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CONCLUSIONS OF A MAN GONE TO THE DEVIL</h2>
</div>

<p>If there is anything in religious inheritance, or in the
influence of a religious environment, I should be, if
not an actual Pastor of a flock, at least one of the most
devout of the faithful, a snooping Brother concerned
only with good works. But instead of carrying on the
work of my forefathers I find myself full of contempt
for the Church, and disgust for the forms of religion.
To me such things are silly; I cannot understand how
grown people can believe in them, or how they can repress
their giggles as they listen to the ministerial platitudes
and perform such mummeries as are the rule in
all churches.</p>

<p>Never since the night of my “conversion” have I gone
into a church to worship. I have frequently entered
such dens of righteousness, but my visits, except for a
few that I made soon after Brother McConnell’s revival
meeting to please my father and mother, have been on
newspaper assignment or out of curiosity. I have inquired
into the doctrine of almost every sect that has
adherents in America, but in none of them have I been
able to find any sign of a true and beneficent God. I
can see only groups of sanctimonious, self-seeking Little
Jack Horners chasing about poking their fingers into
someone else’s pie, and then shouting gleefully: “Look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
at me, God! Look what I found! Ooooh! Ain’t it nice
and smutty?” They cannot practice their religion without
prancing and cavorting before the public eye; they
are constantly showing off. They are not so much concerned
with the glory of God as with the glory of the
front page. And what time they are not whirling giddily
in such imbecilities, they are engaged in disgusting
squabbles among themselves as to who shall have the
local agency for purveying religion; they want to copyright
salvation in the name of their particular sect.</p>

<p>On all sides we hear that religion is the greatest thing
in the world and that mankind’s chief need is more of
it. But it is my conviction that mankind would be infinitely
better off with less of it, and probably best off
with none of it. Nothing has ever caused more trouble.
The whole history of religion is a record of war, murder,
torture, rape, massacre, distrust, hypocrisy, anguish,
persecution and continual and unseemly bickering;
it is a rare church that has not been the scene of disorderly
brawls. It has divided towns and nations into
bitter factions; it has turned brother against sister and
father against son; it has blighted romances; it is a
prime cause of insanity; there is hardly anything harmful
to the human race that it has not done as it pursued
its meddlesome, intolerant way down the ages. Its followers
proclaim loudly that their particular belief is
synonymous with love, and bawl threats and epithets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
against anyone who denies it; but in truth religion
comes more nearly to being synonymous with hatred
and revenge, with each sect praying to God to grant it
special privileges and to damn the others.</p>

<p>I have never at any time regretted my complete withdrawal
from all forms of religion and churchly ceremony.
During many years of my childhood, while
mental and physical habits were forming, these things
kept me in constant terror; I was horrified by the thought
of the awful things that God was preparing to do to me;
I was fearful and miserable lest I give birth to an idea
that was not perfectly righteous and in keeping with
His commands as laid down by His agents. The Bible,
which I necessarily interpreted in the light of what
I had been taught, caused me more nightmares than
any other book I have ever read, and I was vastly more
alarmed by the tales of the fires of Hell related to me
by the Preachers and the Brothers and Sisters than I was
in later life by the thunder of German artillery or the
crackle of machine-gun bullets.</p>

<p>Since I left Farmington I have been near death many
times, both as a soldier in France and from the natural
illnesses incident to civil life. At least three times I
have been told that I had but a few hours to live. Yet
even then I did not feel the need of religion, nor for a
preacher or a priest to pray over me to a God that neither
of us knew, and perform ceremonies founded on pagan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
rites. How can an intelligent God pay any attention to
a last-minute deathbed repentance that it is so obviously
the result of fear and nothing else? The religionist
expects God to wash all his sins off the slate merely because,
when he is about to die, he says he is sorry. If
there be a God, cannot He look into such a shrunken
little soul and see that there is nothing in it but a fear
of death and a horror of the unknown?</p>

<p>I am not an atheist, because for all I know to the
contrary there may be a God, or any number of Gods,
but to me the God worshiped by my forefathers and by
the religionists of to-day is a cruel, preposterous creation
conceived by a people who felt the need of chastisement.
He is a celestial traffic cop, hounded by whimpering
weaklings who beseech Him to tell them they are
on the right road, and yet keep trying to show Him
which way the traffic should go. In the Christian and
Jewish conceptions of the Heavenly Father I can see
nothing that is fit for a civilized man to worship; indeed,
the nearer a man approaches civilization and intelligence,
the less need there is for him to worship anything.
Conversely it is the stupid, illiterate man, knowing
neither how to read nor how to think, who is most
often the religious fanatic. He understands nothing
and is afraid of everything; he goes through life as a
small boy goes past a graveyard at night, whistling to
keep up his courage. He requires religion and its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
twin, superstition, to give him strength to contemplate
the wonders of the sunset and the falling rain.</p>

<p>For my part, I simply refuse to worry about God.
If there is a God, I hope that I may in time find favor
in His sight and obtain my share of the spiritual loot;
there is nothing that I can do about it. And if there is
no God, there is nothing I can do about that, either. I
profess neither knowledge nor theory about the Supreme
Being and the heavenly wonders; knowing nothing, I
believe nothing, and believing nothing, I am prepared
to believe anything, asking only reasonably correct information
and authentic signs. These I fail to find in
selfish prayers, constant squabbling over the wishes of
the Lord and the building of magnificent temples within
sight and hearing of the ramshackle tenements of the
poor. I do not believe that I shall ever find them, for</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Wherefore and whence we are ye cannot know,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor where life springs, nor whither life doth go.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Without religion I thoroughly enjoy the business of
living. I am oppressed by no dreadful taboos, and I
am without fear; I set myself no standards save those
of ordinary self-respect, decent consideration of the
rights and privileges of others, and the observance of
the laws of the land except Prohibition. To my own
satisfaction, at least, I have proved that religion and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
Church are not at all necessary to a full and happy life.
And if I am thus a sinner and my chance of ultimate
salvation forfeit, then the fault lies at the door of those
fanatics whose method of teaching religion to a child
was, and is, to hammer it into his head by constant
threats of terrible punishment, by drawing torturing
word pictures of Hell, by describing God as a vicious,
vindictive old man, by scolding and tormenting and
laying down taboos until the poor child’s brain whirls
in an agony of fright and misery. I know of no better
way to salute them than to refer them to certain words
of their own Savior, to be found in the thirty-fourth
verse of the twenty-third chapter of the Book of St.
Luke.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>If I ever have a son, which now seems unlikely, his
boyhood will be quite different from my own. For him
Sunday shall be a day of rest and pleasure; there shall
be no taboos, and no attendance upon church and Sunday
school unless their performances are more interesting
than other available entertainment. They now rank
just below the moving pictures, and are therefore last.
I shall bring my son in contact with the sacred books of
the Christians, the Jews, the Buddhists and of all the
other religions as rapidly as he is able to comprehend
them, and he shall be permitted to choose his own religion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
if he decides that a religion is necessary to his happiness
and peace of mind. But if he shows any signs
of becoming a preacher, priest or rabbi, or even a
Brother, I shall whale hell out of him. I am that intolerant.</p>
